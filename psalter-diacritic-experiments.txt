\psalm{1}{Beatus vir, qui non abiit, \&c.}
Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the · wa̍y of si̍nners, * and hath not sat in the se̍at · of the sco̍rnful.
2. But his delight is in the la̍w · of the [[Lo̍rd]]; * and in his law will he exercise · himsëlf da̍y and night.
3. And he shall be like a tree planted by̍ · the wa̍ter-side, * that will bring forth his frúit · in due se̍ason.
4. His leaf also · sha̍ll not wi̍ther; * and look, whatsoever he doeth, · i̍t shall pro̍sper.
5. As for the ungodly, it is no̍t · so with the̍m; * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the · fa̍ce of the̍ earth.
6. Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand · i̍n the júdgement, * neither the sinners in the congregation · o̍f the ri̍ghteous.
7. But the [[Lord]] knoweth the wa̍y · of the ri̍ghteous; * and the way of the ungo̍d·ly shall pe̍rish.

\psalm{2}{Quare fremuerunt gentes?}
Why do the heathen so furiously · ra̍ge toge̍ther? * and why do the people ima̍·gine a va̍in thing?
2. The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take co̍un·sel toge̍ther * against the [[Lord]], and against · hi̍s Ano̍inted.
3. Let us break their · bo̍nds asúnder, * and cast a·wa̍y their co̍rds from us.
4. He that dwelleth in heaven shall la̍ugh · them to sco̍rn: * the Lord shall have them · i̍n deri̍sion.
5. Then shall he speak unto the̍m · in his wra̍th, * and vex them in his · so̍re disple̍asure.
6. Yet ha̍ve I · set my Ki̍ng * upon my holy · hi̍ll of Sy̍on.
7. I will preach the law, whereof the [[Lord]] hath sa̍id · unto me̍, * Thou art my Son, this day have · I̍ bego̍tten thee.
8. Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for · thi̍ne inhe̍ritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for · thy̍ posse̍ssion.
9. Thou shalt bruise them with a · ro̍d of i̍ron, * and break them in pieces like a · po̍tter’s ve̍ssel.
10. Be wise now the̍refore, · O ye ki̍ngs; * be learned, ye that are · júdges o̍f the earth.
11. Se̍rve the · [[Lord]] in fe̍ar, * and rejoice unto · hi̍m with re̍verence.
12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish fro̍m · the right wa̍y, * if his wrath be kindled, yea, but a little. Blessed are all they that · pút their trúst in him.

\psalm{3}{Domine, quid multiplicati?}
Lord, how are they incre̍as·ed that tro̍uble me! * many are they that · ri̍se aga̍inst me.
2. Many one there be that sa̍y · of my so̍ul, * There is no help for · hi̍m in hi̍s God.
3. But thou, O [[Lord]], art · my̍ defe̍nder; * thou art my worship, and the lifter · úp of my̍ head.
4. I did call upon the [[Lo̍rd]] · with my vo̍ice, * and he heard me o̍ut · of his ho̍ly hill.
5. I laid me down and slept, and ro̍se · up aga̍in; * for the · [[Lo̍rd]] susta̍ined me.
6. I will not be afraid for ten thousands · o̍f the pe̍ople, * that have set themselves a·ga̍inst me ro̍und about.
7. Up, [[Lord]], and he̍lp me, · O my Go̍d, * for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of · the̍ ungo̍dly.
8. Salvation belongeth ún·to the [[Lo̍rd]]; * and thy blessing is up·o̍n thy pe̍ople.

\psalm{4}{Cum invocarem.}
Hear me when I call, O Go̍d · of my ri̍ghteousness: * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken · únto my̍ prayer.
2. O ye sons of men, how long will ye blas·phe̍me mine ho̍nour, * and have such pleasure in vanity, and se̍ek · after le̍asing?
3. Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the ma̍n · that is go̍dly; * when I call upon the Lord, · he̍ will he̍ar me.
4. Stand in a̍we, · and sin no̍t; * commune with your own heart, and in your · cha̍mber, a̍nd be still.
5. Offer the sacri·fi̍ce of ri̍ghteousness, * and put your · trúst in the̍ [[Lord]].
6. There be ma̍·ny that sa̍y, * Who will · she̍w us a̍ny good?
7. [[Lord]], · li̍ft thou úp * the light of thy counte·na̍nce upo̍n us.
8. Thou hast put gla̍dness · in my he̍art; * since the time that their corn and wine and · o̍il incre̍ased.
9. I will lay me down in pe̍ace, and · take my re̍st; * for it is thou, [[Lord]], only, that makest me · dwe̍ll in sa̍fety.

\psalm{5}{Verba mea auribus.}
Ponder my · wo̍rds, O Lo̍rd, * consider my · me̍dita̍tion
2. O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my Ki̍ng, · and my Go̍d: * for unto the̍e · wi̍ll I ma̍ke my prayer.
3. My voice shalt thou hear be·ti̍mes, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, · a̍nd will lo̍ok up.
4. For thou art the God that hast no ple̍a·sure in wi̍ckedness; * neither shall any · e̍vil dwe̍ll with thee.
5. Such as be foolish shall not sta̍nd · in thy si̍ght; * for thou hatest all the̍m · that work va̍nity.
6. Thou shalt destroy the̍m · that speak le̍asing: * the [[Lord]] will abhor both the blood-thirsty · a̍nd dece̍itful man.
7. But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude · o̍f thy me̍rcy; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy · ho̍ly te̍mple.
8. Lead me, O [[Lord]], in thy righteousness, beca̍use · of mine e̍nemies; * make thy way · pla̍in befo̍re my face.
9. For there is no fa̍ithfulness · in his mo̍uth; * their inward parts are · ve̍ry wi̍ckedness.
10. Their throat is an · o̍pen se̍pulchre; * they · fla̍tter wi̍th their tongue.
11. Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own i·ma̍gina̍tions; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebe̍l·led aga̍inst thee.
12. And let all them that put their trúst in · thee rejo̍ice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be · jo̍yful i̍n thee;
13. For thou, [[Lord]], wilt give thy blessing un·to̍ the ri̍ghteous, * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defe̍nd · him as wi̍th a shield.

\psalterday{1}{Evening}
\psalm{6}{Domine, ne in furore.}
O Lord, rebuke me not in thine · i̍ndigna̍tion, * neither chasten me in · thy̍ disple̍asure. 
2. Have mercy upon me, O [[Lo̍rd]], for · I am we̍ak; * O [[Lord]], heal me, for my · bo̍nes are ve̍xed.
3. My soul also · is so̍re tro̍ubled: * but, [[Lord]], how long · wi̍lt thou púnish me?
4. Turn thee, O [[Lord]], and deli̍·ver my so̍ul; * O save me · fo̍r thy me̍rcy’s sake.
5. For in death no man reme̍m·bereth the̍e; * and who will give · thee thänks i̍n the pit?
6. I am weary of my groaning; every night wa̍sh · I my be̍d, * and water my · co̍uch with my̍ tears.
7. My beauty is gone for · ve̍ry tro̍uble, * and worn away because of · a̍ll mine e̍nemies.
8. Away from me, all ye̍ · that work va̍nity; * for the [[Lord]] hath heard the vo̍ice · of my we̍eping.
9. The [[Lord]] hath heard · my̍ peti̍tion; * the [[Lo̍rd]] · will rece̍ive my prayer.
10. All mine enemies shall be confounded, · and so̍re ve̍xed; * they shall be turned back, and put · to shäme súddenly.

\psalm{7}{Domine, Deus meus.}
O Lord my God, in thee ha̍ve I · put my trúst: * save me from all them that persecute me, · a̍nd deli̍ver me;
2. Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and te̍ar · it in pi̍eces, * while · the̍re is no̍ne to help.
3. O [[Lord]] my God, if I have done a̍·ny such thi̍ng; * or if there be any wi̍ck·edness i̍n my hands;
4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt fri̍end·ly with me̍; * yea, I have delivered him that without any cause · i̍s mine e̍nemy,
5. Then let mine enemy persecute my · so̍ul, and ta̍ke me; * yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine · ho̍nour i̍n the dust.
6. Stand up, O [[Lord]], in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation · o̍f mine e̍nemies; * arise up for me in the judgement that thou · ha̍st comma̍nded.
7. And so shall the congregation of the people co̍me · about the̍e: * for their sakes therefore lift · úp thyse̍lf again.
8. The [[Lord]] shall judge the people: give sentence wi̍th · me, O [[Lo̍rd]], * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency · tha̍t is i̍n me.
9. O let the wickedness of the ungodly co̍me · to an e̍nd; * – · but güide tho̍u the just.
10. For the · ri̍ghteous Go̍d * trieth the · ve̍ry he̍arts and reins.
11. My help co̍m·eth of Go̍d, * who preserveth the̍m · that are trúe of heart.
12. God is a righteous Judge, · stro̍ng, and pa̍tient; * and God is pro·vo̍ked e̍very day.
13. If a man will not turn, he̍ will · whet his swo̍rd; * he hath bent his bow, and · ma̍de it re̍ady.
14. He hath prepared for him the i̍nstru·ments of de̍ath; * he ordaineth his arrows against the · pe̍rsecútors.
15. Behold, he travail·e̍th with mi̍schief; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought · fo̍rth ungo̍dliness.
16. He hath graven and di̍gged · up a pi̍t, * and is fallen on himself into the destruction that he · ma̍de for o̍ther.
17. For his travail shall come upo̍n · his own he̍ad, * and his wickedness shall fa̍ll · on his o̍wn pate.
18. I will give thanks unto the [[Lord]], according · to̍ his ri̍ghteousness; * and I will praise the Na̍me · of the [[Lo̍rd]] Most High.

\psalm{8}{Domine, Dominus noster.} 
O Lord our Governor, how excellent is thy Na̍me in · all the wo̍rld; * thou that hast set thy glory a·bo̍ve the he̍avens! 
2. Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, beca̍use · of thine e̍nemies, * that thou mightest still the enemy a̍nd · the ave̍nger.
3. For I will consider thy heavens, even the wo̍rks · of thy fi̍ngers; * the moon and the stars, which thou · ha̍st orda̍ined.
4. What is man, that thou art mi̍nd·ful of hi̍m? * and the son of man, that thou · vi̍site̍st him?
5. Thou madest him lower · tha̍n the a̍ngels, * to crown him with glo̍·ry and wo̍rship.
6. Thou makest him to have dominion of the wo̍rks · of thy ha̍nds; * and thou hast put all things in subjection · únder hi̍s feet;
7. All · she̍ep and o̍xen; * yea, and the · be̍asts of the̍ field;
8. The fowls of the air, and the fi̍shes · of the se̍a; * and whatsoever walketh through the · pa̍ths of the̍ seas.
9. O · [[Lo̍rd]] our Go̍vernor, * how excellent is thy · Na̍me in a̍ll the world!




\psalterday{2}{Morning}
\psalm{9}{Confitebor tibi.}
I will give thanks unto thee, O [[Lord]], wi̍th · my whole he̍art; * I will speak of all thy · ma̍rvello̍us works.
2. I will be gla̍d and re·joice in the̍e; * yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O · tho̍u Most Hi̍ghest.
3. While mine enemi̍es are · driven ba̍ck, * they shall fall and perish · a̍t thy pre̍sence.
4. For thou hast maintained my ri̍ght · and my ca̍use; * thou art set in the · thro̍ne that júdgest right.
5. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed · the̍ ungo̍dly; * thou hast put out their name for e̍v·er and e̍ver.
6. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpe̍·tual e̍nd; * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, their memorial is pe̍·rished wi̍th them.
7. But the [[Lord]] shall en·dúre for e̍ver; * he hath also prepared his · se̍at for júdgement.
8. For he shall judge the · wo̍rld in ri̍ghteousness, * and minister true judgement un·to̍ the pe̍ople.
9. The [[Lord]] also will be a defence fo̍r · the oppre̍ssed, * even a refuge in due · ti̍me of tro̍uble.
10. And they that know thy Name will pút their · trust in the̍e; * for thou, [[Lord]], hast never failed · the̍m that se̍ek thee.
11. O praise the [[Lord]] which dwe̍ll·eth in Sy̍on; * shew the people · o̍f his do̍ings.
12. For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he re\-me̍m·\-bereth the̍m, * and forgetteth not the com·pla̍int of the̍ poor.
13. Have mercy upon me, O [[Lord]]; consider the trouble which I suffer of · the̍m that ha̍te me, * thou that liftest me up · fro̍m the ga̍tes of death.
14. That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the da̍ugh·ter of Sy̍on: * I will rejoice in · thy̍ salva̍tion.
15. The heathen are sunk down in the pi̍t · that they ma̍de; * in the same net which they hid privily, is · their föot ta̍ken.
16. The [[Lord]] is known to e̍x·ecute júdgement; * the ungodly is trapped in the wo̍rk · of his o̍wn hands.
17. The wicked shall be túrned · into he̍ll, * and all the people · tha̍t forge̍t God.
18. For the poor shall not alway · be̍ forgo̍tten; * the patient abiding of the meek shall not pe̍·rish for e̍ver.
19. Up, [[Lord]], and let not man ha̍ve the · upper ha̍nd; * let the heathen be júdg·ed in thy̍ sight.
20. Put the̍m in · fear, O [[Lo̍rd]], * that the heathen may know them·se̍lves to be̍ but men.

\psalm{10}{Ut quid, Domine?}
Why standest thou so far · o̍ff, O [[Lo̍rd]], * and hidest thy face in the needful · ti̍me of tro̍uble?
2. The ungodly for his own lust doth pe̍rse·cute the po̍or: * let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they · ha̍ve ima̍gined.
3. For the ungodly hath made boast of his own · he̍art’s desi̍re, * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom · [[Go̍d]] abho̍rreth.
4. The ungodly is so proud, that he ca̍reth · not for Go̍d, * neither is · Go̍d in a̍ll his thoughts.
5. His ways are · a̍lway gri̍evous; * thy judgements are far above out of his sight, and therefore defieth he · a̍ll his e̍nemies.
6. For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall ne̍ver · be cast do̍wn, * there shall no harm ha̍p·pen unto̍ me.
7. His mouth is full of cursing, de·ce̍it, and fra̍ud; * under his tongue is ungodli·ne̍ss and va̍nity.
8. He sitteth lurking in the thievish co̍rners · of the stre̍ets, * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are · se̍t aga̍inst the poor.
9. For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he̍ · in his de̍n, * that he may · ra̍vish the̍ poor.
10. He doth ra̍·vish the po̍or, * when he getteth him · i̍nto hi̍s net.
11. He falleth down, and húm·bleth himse̍lf, * that the congregation of the poor may fall into the ha̍nds · of his ca̍ptains.
12. He hath said in his heart, Tush, God · ha̍th forgo̍tten; * he hideth away his face, and he will · ne̍ver se̍e it.
13. Arise, O [[Lord]] God, and li̍ft · up thine ha̍nd; * – · forgët no̍t the poor.
14. Wherefore should the wi̍cked · blaspheme Go̍d, * while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God ca̍r·est not fo̍r it?
15. Surely · tho̍u hast se̍en it; * for thou beholdest ungo̍d·liness a̍nd wrong,
16. That thou mayest take the matter i̍n·to thy ha̍nd; * the poor committeth himself unto thee; for thou art the helper · o̍f the fri̍endless.
17. Break thou the power of the ungodly · a̍nd mali̍cious; * take away his ungodliness, and · tho̍u shalt fi̍nd none.
18. The [[Lord]] is King for e̍v·er and e̍ver, * and the heathen are perished · o̍ut of the̍ land.
19. [[Lord]], thou hast heard the desi̍re · of the po̍or; * thou preparest their heart, and thine ear he̍ark·eneth the̍reto;
20. To help the fatherless and poor ún·to their ri̍ght, * that the man of the earth be no more exa̍l·ted aga̍inst them.

\psalm{11}{In Domino confido.}
In the [[Lord]] pút · I my trúst; * how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a · bi̍rd unto̍ the hill?
2. For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows with·i̍n the qui̍ver, * that they may privily shoot at the̍m · which are trúe of heart.
3. For the foundations wi̍ll · be cast do̍wn, * and wha̍t · hath the ri̍ghteous done?
4. The [[Lord]] is in his · ho̍ly te̍mple; * the [[Lord]]’s se̍at · is in he̍aven.
5. His eyes consi̍·der the po̍or, * and his eyelids try the · chi̍ldren o̍f men.
6. The [[Lord]] allo̍w·eth the ri̍ghteous: * but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness, · do̍th his so̍ul abhor.
7. Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, · sto̍rm and te̍mpest: * this shall be their · po̍rtion to̍ drink.
8. For the righteous [[Lord]] · lo̍veth ri̍ghteousness; * his countenance will behold the · thi̍ng that i̍s just.


\psalterday{2}{Evening}
\psalm{12}{Salvum me fac.}
Help me, [[Lord]], for there is not one go̍d·ly man le̍ft; * for the faithful are minished from among the · chi̍ldren o̍f men.
2. They talk of vanity every one · wi̍th his ne̍ighbour; * they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble · i̍n their do̍uble heart.
3. The [[Lord]] shall root out a̍ll de·ceitful li̍ps, * and the tongue that · spe̍aketh pro̍ud things;
4. Which have said, With our to̍ngue will · we preva̍il; * we are they that ought to speak; who · is lörd o̍ver us?
5. Now for the comfortless trouble’s sa̍ke · of the ne̍edy, * and because of the deep · si̍ghing o̍f the poor,
6. I will úp, · saith the [[Lo̍rd]]; * and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will · se̍t him a̍t rest.
7. The words of the · [[Lo̍rd]] are púre words; * even as the silver, which from the earth is tried, and purified se̍·ven times i̍n the fire.
8. Thou shalt ke̍ep · them, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * thou shalt preserve him from this genera̍·tion for e̍ver.
9. The ungodly walk on e̍v·ery si̍de: * when they are exalted, the children of men are · pút to re̍buke.

\psalm{13}{Usque quo, Domine?}
How long wilt thou forget me, O · Lo̍rd; for e̍ver? * how long wilt thou · hi̍de thy fa̍ce from me?
2. How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so ve̍xed · in my he̍art? * how long shall mine enemies · tri̍umph o̍ver me?
3. Consider, and he̍ar me, O · [[Lord]] my Go̍d; * lighten mine eyes, that I · sle̍ep not i̍n death.
4. Lest mine enemy say, I have preva̍il·ed aga̍inst him: * for if I be cast down, they that trouble me · wi̍ll rejo̍ice at it.
5. But my trust is · i̍n thy me̍rcy, * and my heart is joyful in · thy̍ salva̍tion.
6. I will sing of the [[Lord]], because he hath dealt so lo̍ving·ly with me̍; * yea, I will praise the Name of the · Lo̍rd Most Hi̍ghest.

\psalm{14}{Dixit insipiens.} 
The fool hath sa̍id · in his he̍art, * – · The̍re is no̍ God.
2. They are corrupt, and become abominable · i̍n their do̍ings; * there is none that do·eth göod, no̍ not one.
3. The [[Lord]] looked down from heaven upon the chi̍l·dren of me̍n, * to see if there were any that would understand, · and sëek a̍fter God.
4. But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become a·bo̍mina̍ble; * there is none that do·eth göod, no̍ not one.
5. Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have · the̍y dece̍ived; * the poison of asps is · únder the̍ir lips.
6. Their mouth is full of cúrs·ing and bi̍tterness; * their feet are · swi̍ft to she̍d blood.
7. Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace ha̍ve · they not kno̍wn; * there is no fear of · Go̍d befo̍re their eyes.
8. Have they no knowledge, that they are all such wo̍rk·ers of mi̍schief, * eating up my people as it were bread, and call · no̍t upo̍n the [[Lord]]?
9. There were they brought in great fear, even whe̍re · no fear wa̍s; * for God is in the generation · o̍f the ri̍ghteous.
10. As for you, ye have made a mock at the co̍unsel · of the po̍or; * because he putteth his · trúst in the̍ [[Lord]].
11. Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Syon? When the [[Lord]] turneth the captivity · o̍f his pe̍ople, * then shall Iacob rejoice, and I̍s·rael sha̍ll be glad.


\psalterday{3}{Morning}
\psalm{15}{Domine, quis habitabit?} 
Lord, who shall dwell in thy · ta̍berna̍cle? * or who shall rest up·o̍n thy ho̍ly hill?
2. Even he that leadeth an ún·corrupt li̍fe, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the · trúth from hi̍s heart.
3. He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil · to̍ his ne̍ighbour, * and hath not slander·e̍d his ne̍ighbour.
4. He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly i̍n · his own e̍yes, * and maketh much of · the̍m that fe̍ar the [[Lord]].
5. He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappo̍in·teth him no̍t, * though it were to · his öwn hi̍ndrance.
6. He that hath not given his money · úpon úsury, * nor taken reward a·ga̍inst the i̍nnocent.
7. Whoso do̍·eth these thi̍ngs * – · – shall ne̍ver fall.

\psalm{16}{Conserva me, Domine.} 
Prese̍rve · me, O Go̍d; * for in thee · ha̍ve I pút my trust.
2. O my soul, thou hast sa̍id un·to the [[Lo̍rd]], * Thou art my God; my goods are · no̍thing únto thee.
3. All my delight is upon the saints, tha̍t are · in the e̍arth, * and upon such as ex·ce̍l in vi̍rtue.
4. But they that run a̍fter an·other go̍d * shall · ha̍ve great tro̍uble.
5. Their drink-offerings of blood will · I̍ not o̍ffer, * neither make mention of their · na̍mes withi̍n my lips.
6. The [[Lord]] himself is the portion of mine inheritance, a̍nd · of my cúp; * thou · sha̍lt mainta̍in my lot.
7. The lot is fallen unto me i̍n · a fair gro̍und; * yea, I have a · go̍odly he̍ritage.
8. I will thank the [[Lord]] for gi̍v·ing me wa̍rning; * my reins also chasten me in · the nïght-se̍ason.
9. I have set [[God]] a̍l·ways befo̍re me; * for he is on my right hand, therefore · I̍ shall no̍t fall.
10. Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glo̍·ry rejo̍iced: * my flesh a̍l·so shall re̍st in hope.
11. For why? thou shalt not le̍ave my · soul in he̍ll; * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to · se̍e corrúption.
12. Thou shalt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is the fúl·ness of jo̍y, * and at thy right hand there is ple̍a·sure for e̍vermore.

\psalm{17}{Exaudi, Domine.} 
Hear the right, O [[Lord]], consi̍der · my compla̍int, * and hearken unto my prayer, that goeth not · o̍ut of fe̍igned lips.
2. Let my sentence come forth · fro̍m thy pre̍sence; * and let thine eyes look upon the thi̍ng · that is e̍qual.
3. Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wi̍cked·ness in me̍; * for I am utterly purposed that my · mo̍uth shall no̍t offend.
4. Because of men’s works, that are done against the wo̍rds · of thy li̍ps: * I have kept me from the ways o̍f · the destro̍yer.
5. O hold thou up my go̍ings · in thy pa̍ths, * that my · fo̍otsteps sli̍p not.
6. I have called upon thee, O God, for · tho̍u shalt he̍ar me: * incline thine ear to me, and hearken · únto my̍ words.
7. Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which pút their · trust in the̍e, * from such as re·si̍st thy ri̍ght hand.
8. Keep me as the a̍pple · of an e̍ye; * hide me under the sha̍·dow of thy̍ wings.
9. From the ungo̍d·ly that tro̍uble me; * mine enemies compass me round about to · ta̍ke awa̍y my soul.
10. They are inclosed i̍n · their own fa̍t, * and their mouth · spe̍aketh pro̍ud things.
11. They lie waiting in our way on e̍·very si̍de, * turning their eyes · do̍wn to the̍ ground.
12. Like as a lion that is gre̍edy · of his pre̍y, * and as it were a lion’s whelp, lurking in · se̍cret pla̍ces.
13. Up, [[Lord,]] disappoint him, and · ca̍st him do̍wn; * deliver my soul from the ungodly, which · i̍s a swo̍rd of thine;
14. From the men of thy hand, O [[Lord]]; from the men, I say, and fro̍m the · evil wo̍rld; * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with · thy̍ hid tre̍asure.
15. They have chi̍ldren at · their desi̍re, * and leave the rest of their súb·stance for the̍ir babes.
16. But as for me, I will behold thy pre̍·sence in ri̍ghteousness; * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satis·fi̍ed wi̍th it.

I will love thee, O [[Lord]], my strength. The [[Lord]] is my stony ro̍ck, and · my defe̍nce; * my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, · a̍nd my re̍fuge.
2. I will call upon the [[Lord]], which is worthy · to̍ be pra̍ised; * so shall I be safe · fro̍m mine e̍nemies.
3. The sorrows of death co̍m·passed me̍, * and the overflowings of ungodli·ness ma̍de me̍ afraid.
4. The pains of hell ca̍me · about me̍; * the snares of death · o̍verto̍ok me.
5. In my trouble I will ca̍ll up·on the [[Lo̍rd]], * and complain · únto my̍ God:
6. So shall he hear my voice out of his · ho̍ly te̍mple, * and my complaint shall come before him; it shall enter even · i̍nto hi̍s ears.

7. The earth tre̍m·bled and qua̍ked, * the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed, · beca̍use he̍ was wroth.
8. There went a smoke out · i̍n his pre̍sence, * and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were · ki̍ndled a̍t it.
9. He bowed the heavens a̍lso, · and came do̍wn, * and it was dark · únder hi̍s feet.
10. He rode upon the Cherubins, · a̍nd did fly̍; * he came flying upon · the wi̍ngs o̍f the wind.
11. He made da̍rkness his · secret pla̍ce, * his pavilion round about him, with dark water and thick · clo̍uds to co̍ver him.
12. At the brightness of his presence his · clo̍uds remo̍ved; * hail·sto̍nes, and co̍als of fire.
13. The [[Lord]] also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest · ga̍ve his thúnder; * hail·sto̍nes, and co̍als of fire.
14. He sent out his arrows, and sca̍t·tered the̍m; * he cast forth lightnings, · a̍nd destro̍yed them.
15. The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were discovered, at thy chi̍·ding, O [[Lo̍rd]], * at the blasting of the breath of · thy̍ disple̍asure.
16. He shall send down from on · hi̍gh to fe̍tch me, * and shall take me out of · ma̍ny wa̍ters.
17. He shall deliver me from my strongest enemy, and from · the̍m which ha̍te me; * for they are too · mi̍ghty fo̍r me.
18. They prevented me in the da̍y · of my tro̍uble; * but the [[Lord]] was · my̍ upho̍lder.
19. He brought me forth also into a · pla̍ce of li̍berty; * he brought me forth, even because he had a · fa̍vour únto me.

20. The [[Lord]] shall reward me after my · ri̍ghteous de̍aling, * according to the cleanness of my hands shall he · re̍compe̍nse me.
21. Because I have kept the wa̍ys · of the [[Lo̍rd]], * and have not forsaken my God, · a̍s the wi̍cked doth.
22. For I have an eye únto · all his la̍ws, * and will not cast out his com·ma̍ndments fro̍m me.
23. I was also uncor·rúpt befo̍re him, * and eschewed · mine öwn wi̍ckedness.
24. Therefore shall the [[Lord]] reward me after my · ri̍ghteous de̍aling, * and according unto the cleanness of my hands · i̍n his e̍yesight.
25. With the holy thou · sha̍lt be ho̍ly, * and with a perfect man thou · sha̍lt be pe̍rfect.
26. With the cle̍an thou · shalt be cle̍an, * and with the froward thou · sha̍lt learn fro̍wardness.
27. For thou shalt save the people that are · i̍n adve̍rsity, * and shalt bring down the · hi̍gh looks o̍f the proud.
28. Thou also shalt · li̍ght my ca̍ndle; * the [[Lord]] my God shall make my · da̍rkness to̍ be light.
29. For in thee I shall disco̍mfit an · host of me̍n, * and with the help of my God I shall leap · o̍ver the̍ wall.
30. The way of God is an únde·filed wa̍y: * the word of the [[Lord]] also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that · pút their trúst in him.
31. For who is Go̍d, · but the [[Lo̍rd]]? * or who hath any stre̍ngth, · except o̍ur God?
32. It is God, that girdeth me̍ with · strength of wa̍r, * and maketh · my wäy pe̍rfect.
33. He maketh my · fe̍et like ha̍rts’ feet, * and se̍t·teth me úp on high.
34. He te̍acheth mine · hands to fi̍ght, * and mine arms shall break e̍·ven a bo̍w of steel.

35. Thou hast given me the defence of · thy̍ salva̍tion; * thy right hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving corre̍c·tion shall ma̍ke me great.
36. Thou shalt make room enough under me̍ · for to go̍, * that my · fo̍otsteps sha̍ll not slide.
37. I will follow upon mine enemies, and · o̍verta̍ke them; * neither will I turn again till I̍ · have destro̍yed them.
38. I will smite them, that they shall not be a̍·ble to sta̍nd, * but fall · únder my̍ feet.
39. Thou hast girded me with strength un·to̍ the ba̍ttle; * thou shalt throw down mine e̍·nemies únder me.
40. Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their · ba̍cks upo̍n me, * and I shall destroy · the̍m that ha̍te me.
41. They shall cry, but there shall be · no̍ne to he̍lp them; * yea, even unto the [[Lord]] shall they cry, but he · sha̍ll not he̍ar them.
42. I will beat them as small as the dúst be·fore the wi̍nd: * I will cast them out as the · cla̍y in the̍ streets.
43. Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings · o̍f the pe̍ople, * and thou shalt make me the he̍ad · of the he̍athen.
44. A people who̍m I · have not kno̍wn * – · – shall se̍rve me.
45. As soon as they hear of me, they · sha̍ll obe̍y me; * but the strange children shall dis·se̍mble wi̍th me.
46. The strange chi̍ldren shall fa̍il, * and be afraid o̍ut · of their pri̍sons.
47. The [[Lord]] liveth, and blessed be · my̍ strong he̍lper, * and praised be the Lord of · my̍ salva̍tion;
48. Even the God that seeth that I · be̍ ave̍nged, * and subdueth the · pe̍ople únto me.
49. It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine · a̍dversa̍ries: * thou shalt rid me · fro̍m the wi̍cked man.
50. For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O [[Lord]], amo̍ng the Ge̍ntiles, * and sing praises · únto thy̍ Name.
51. Great prosperity giveth he ún·to his Ki̍ng, * and sheweth loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his · se̍ed for e̍vermore.


\psalterday{4}{Morning}
\psalm{19}{Cœli enarrant.} 
The heavens declare the glo̍·ry of Go̍d; * and the firmament she̍w·eth his ha̍ndywork.
2. One day te̍l·leth ano̍ther; * and one night certifi̍·eth ano̍ther.
3. There is neither · spe̍ech nor la̍nguage; * but their voices are · he̍ard amo̍ng them.
4. Their sound is gone out i̍n·to all la̍nds; * and their words into the · e̍nds of the̍ world.
5. In them hath he set a taberna̍cle · for the sún; * which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a  gi̍·ant to rún his course.
6. It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the e̍nd of · it aga̍in; * and there is nothing hi̍d · from the he̍at thereof.
7. The law of the [[Lord]] is an undefiled law, conve̍r·ting the so̍ul; * the testimony of the [[Lord]] is sure, and giveth wisdom ún·to the si̍mple.
8. The statutes of the [[Lord]] are right, a̍nd re·joice the he̍art; * the commandment of the [[Lord]] is pure, and giveth · li̍ght unto̍ the eyes.
9. The fear of the [[Lord]] is clean, and endúr·eth for e̍ver; * the judgements of the [[Lord]] are true, and righteous · a̍ltoge̍ther.
10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, · tha̍n much fi̍ne gold; * sweeter also than honey, · a̍nd the ho̍ney-comb.
11. Moreover, by them i̍s thy · servant ta̍ught; * and in keeping of them · the̍re is gre̍at reward.
12. Who can tell how o̍ft · he offe̍ndeth? * O cleanse thou me · fro̍m my se̍cret faults.
13. Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the do·mi̍nion o̍ver me; * so shall I be undefiled, and innocent · fro̍m the gre̍at offence.
14. Let the words of my mouth, and the medita̍tion · of my he̍art, * be alway acce̍pta·ble in thy̍ sight,
15. O [[Lord]], – * my strength, and · my̍ rede̍emer.

\psalm{20}{Exaudiat te Dominus.} 
The [[Lord]] hear thee in the · da̍y of tro̍uble; * the Name of the God of Ja̍·cob defe̍nd thee;
2. Send thee help from the · sa̍nctua̍ry, * and strengthen thee · o̍ut of Sy̍on:
3. Remember · a̍ll thy o̍fferings, * and accept · thy̍ burnt-sa̍crifice;
4. Grant the̍e thy · heart’s desi̍re, * and ful·fi̍l all thy̍ mind.
5. We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Na̍me of the · Lord our Go̍d * the [[Lord]] perform all · thy̍ peti̍tions.
6. Now know I that the [[Lord]] helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his · ho̍ly he̍aven, * even with the wholesome stre̍ngth · of his ri̍ght hand.
7. Some put their trust in chariots, and · so̍me in ho̍rses; * but we will remember the Na̍me · of the [[Lo̍rd]] our God.
8. They are brought · do̍wn, and fa̍llen; * but we are ri̍·sen, and sta̍nd upright.
9. Save, [[Lord]]; and hear us, O · Ki̍ng of he̍aven, * when we · ca̍ll upo̍n thee.

\psalm{21}{Domine, in virtute tua.} 
The King shall rejoice i̍n thy · strength, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * exceeding glad shall he be of · thy̍ salva̍tion.
2. Thou hast given hi̍m his · heart’s desi̍re, * and hast not denied him the re·que̍st of hi̍s lips.
3. For thou shalt prevent him with the ble̍s·sings of go̍odness, * and shalt set a crown of pure go̍ld · upon hi̍s head.
4. He asked life of thee; and thou gavest · hi̍m a lo̍ng life, * even for e̍v·er and e̍ver.
5. His honour is great in · thy̍ salva̍tion; * glory and great worship shalt thou · la̍y upo̍n him.
6. For thou shalt give him everlast·ing feli̍city, * and make him glad with the jo̍y · of thy co̍untenance.
7. And why? because the King putteth his trúst · in the [[Lo̍rd]]; * and in the mercy of the Most Highest he shall · no̍t misca̍rry.
8. All thine enemies shall · fe̍el thine ha̍nd; * thy right hand shall find out · the̍m that ha̍te thee.
9. Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in ti̍me · of thy wra̍th: * the [[Lord]] shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire · sha̍ll consúme them.
10. Their fruit shalt thou root o̍ut · of the e̍arth, * and their seed from among the · chi̍ldren o̍f men.
11. For they intended mi̍schief · against the̍e, * and imagined such a device as they are not · a̍ble to̍ perform.
12. Therefore shalt thou pút · them to fli̍ght, * and the strings of thy bow shalt thou make ready a·ga̍inst the fa̍ce of them.
13. Be thou exalted, [[Lord]], i̍n · thine own stre̍ngth; * so we will sing, and · pra̍ise thy po̍wer.

\psalterday{4}{Evening}
\psalm{22}{Deus, Deus meus.}
My God, my God, look upon me; why hast · tho̍u forsa̍ken me? * and art so far from my health, and from the · wo̍rds of my̍ complaint?
2. O my God, I cry in the day-time, bút thou · hearest no̍t; * and in the night-season a̍l·so I ta̍ke no rest.
3. And thou conti̍n·uest ho̍ly, * O thou wo̍r·ship of I̍srael.
4. Our fathers ho̍·ped in the̍e; * they trusted in thee, and thou · di̍dst deli̍ver them.
5. They called upon thee, · a̍nd were ho̍lpen; * they put their trust in thee, and were · no̍t confo̍unded.
6. But as for me, I am a wo̍rm, · and no ma̍n; * a very scorn of men, and the outcast · o̍f the pe̍ople.
7. All they that see me la̍ugh · me to sco̍rn; * they shoot our their lips, and shake · their hëads, sa̍ying,
8. He trusted in [[God]], that he̍ · would deli̍ver him; * let him deliver him, if · he̍ will ha̍ve him.
9. But thou art he that took me o̍ut of my · mother’s wo̍mb; * thou wast my hope, when I hanged yet up·o̍n my mo̍ther’s breasts.
10. I have been left unto thee ever si̍nce · I was bo̍rn; * thou art my God, even · fro̍m my mo̍ther’s womb.
11. O go not from me, for tro̍uble is · hard at ha̍nd, * and there is · no̍ne to he̍lp me.
12. Many oxen are · co̍me abo̍ut me; * fat bulls of Basan close me · i̍n on e̍very side.
13. They gape upo̍n me · with their mo̍uths, * as it were a ramping and a · ro̍aring li̍on.
14. I am poured out like water, and all my bo̍nes are · out of jo̍int; * my heart also in the midst of my body is e̍·ven like me̍lting wax.
15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cle̍aveth · to my gúms, * and thou shalt bring me i̍n·to the dúst of death.
16. For many dogs are · co̍me abo̍ut me, * and the council of the wicked layeth · si̍ege aga̍inst me.
17. They pierced my hands and my feet; I may te̍ll · all my bo̍nes: * they stand staring and lo̍ok·ing upo̍n me.
18. They part my ga̍r·ments amo̍ng them, * and casts lots up·o̍n my ve̍sture.
19. But be not thou fa̍r from · me, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * thou art my succour, ha̍ste · thee to he̍lp me.

20. Deliver my so̍ul · from the swo̍rd, * my darling from the · po̍wer o̍f the dog.
21. Save me fro̍m the · lion’s mo̍uth; * thou hast heard me also from among the ho̍rns · of the únicorns.
22. I will declare thy Name un·to̍ my bre̍thren; * in the midst of the congregation · wi̍ll I pra̍ise thee.
23. O praise the [[Lord]], · ye̍ that fe̍ar him: * magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye · se̍ed of I̍srael.
24. For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low esta̍te · of the po̍or; * he hath not hid his face from him; but when he called unto · hi̍m he he̍ard him.
25. My praise is of thee in the great · co̍ngrega̍tion; * my vows will I perform in the sight of · the̍m that fe̍ar him.
26. The poor shall eat and be · sa̍tisfi̍ed; * they that seek after the [[Lord]] shall praise him; your heart shall · li̍ve for e̍ver.
27. All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned ún·to the [[Lo̍rd]]; * and all the kindreds of the nations shall wo̍r·ship befo̍re him.
28. For the ki̍ngdom · is the [[Lo̍rd]]’s, * and he is the Governor a·mo̍ng the pe̍ople.
29. All such as be fa̍t · upon e̍arth * have e̍at·en and wo̍rshipped.
30. All they that go down into the dust shall · kne̍el befo̍re him; * and no man hath qui̍cken·ed his o̍wn soul.
31. My · se̍ed shall se̍rve him: * they shall be counted unto the Lord for a · ge̍nera̍tion.
32. They shall come, and the heavens shall de·cla̍re his ri̍ghteousness * unto a people that shall be born, · who̍m the Lo̍rd hath made.

\psalm{23}{Dominus regit me.}
The [[Lord]] · i̍s my she̍pherd; * therefore can · I̍ lack no̍thing.
2. He shall feed me in · a gre̍en pa̍sture, * and lead me forth beside the wa̍·ters of co̍mfort.
3. He shall con·ve̍rt my so̍ul, * and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, · fo̍r his Na̍me’s sake.
4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will · fe̍ar no e̍vil; * for thou art with me; thy rod and · thy stäff co̍mfort me.
5. Thou shalt prepare a table before me against · the̍m that tro̍uble me; * thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my · cúp shall be̍ full.
6. But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the da̍ys · of my li̍fe; * and I will dwell in the house of the · Lo̍rd for e̍ver.

\psalm{24}{Domini est terra.}
The earth is the [[Lord]]’s, and a̍ll that · therein i̍s; * the compass of the world, and · the̍y that dwe̍ll therein.
2. For he hath founded i̍t up·on the se̍as, * and prepared · i̍t upo̍n the floods.
3. Who shall ascend into the hi̍ll · of the [[Lo̍rd]]? * or who shall rise úp · in his ho̍ly place?
4. Even he that hath clean hands, a̍nd · a pure he̍art; * and that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to de·ce̍ive his ne̍ighbour.
5. He shall receive the ble̍ssing · from the [[Lo̍rd]], * and righteousness from the God of · hi̍s salva̍tion.
6. This is the generation of · the̍m that se̍ek him; * even of them that seek thy · fa̍ce, O Ja̍cob.
7. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye e̍ver·lasting do̍ors; * and the King of glo̍·ry shall co̍me in.
8. Who is the · Ki̍ng of glo̍ry? * it is the [[Lord]] strong and mighty, even the [[Lord]] mi̍gh·ty in ba̍ttle.
9. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye e̍ver·lasting do̍ors; * and the King of glo̍·ry shall co̍me in.
10. Who is the · Ki̍ng of glo̍ry? * even the [[Lord]] of hosts, he is the · Ki̍ng of glo̍ry.

\psalm{25}{Ad te, Domine, levavi.}
Unto thee, O [[Lord]], will I lift up my soul; my God, I have pút my · trust in the̍e: * O let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies · tri̍umph o̍ver me.
2. For all they that hope in thee shall no̍t · be asha̍med; * but such as transgress without a cause shall be pút · to confúsion.
3. Shew me̍ thy · ways, O [[Lo̍rd]], * and · te̍ach me thy̍ paths.
4. Lead me forth in thy · trúth, and le̍arn me: * for thou art the God of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope · a̍ll the da̍y long.
5. Call to remembrance, O [[Lord]], thy · te̍nder me̍rcies, * and thy loving-kindnesses, which have been · e̍ver o̍f old.
6. O remember not the sins and offe̍nces · of my yo̍uth; * but according to thy mercy think thou upon me, O [[Lord]], · fo̍r thy go̍odness.
7. Gracious and ri̍ghteous · is the [[Lo̍rd]]; * therefore will he teach · si̍nners i̍n the way.
8. Them that are meek shall he gúide in júdgement; * and such as are gentle, them · sha̍ll he le̍arn his way.
9. All the paths of the [[Lord]] are me̍r·cy and trúth, * unto such as keep his covenant and his · te̍stimo̍nies.
10. For thy Na̍me’s · sake, O [[Lo̍rd]], * be merciful unto my · si̍n, for i̍t is great.
11. What man is he that fe̍ar·eth the [[Lo̍rd]]? * him shall he teach in the · wa̍y that he̍ shall choose.
12. His so̍ul shall · dwell at e̍ase, * and his seed shall in·he̍rit the̍ land.
13. The secret of the [[Lord]] is among · the̍m that fe̍ar him; * and he will she̍w · them his co̍venant.
14. Mine eyes are ever looking ún·to the [[Lo̍rd]]; * for he shall pluck my feet · o̍ut of the̍ net.
15. Turn thee unto me, and have me̍r·cy upo̍n me; * for I am desolate · a̍nd in mi̍sery.

\psalm{27}{Dominus illuminatio.}
The [[Lord]] is my light and my salvation; who̍m then · shall I fe̍ar? * the [[Lord]] is the strength of my life; of whom then · sha̍ll I be̍ afraid?
2. When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to e̍at · up my fle̍sh, * they · stúmbled a̍nd fell.
3. Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my he̍art · be afra̍id; * and though there rose up war against me, yet will I · pút my trúst in him.
4. One thing have I desired of the [[Lord]], which I̍ · will requi̍re; * even that I may dwell in the house of the [[Lord]] all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the [[Lord]], and to vi̍·sit his te̍mple.
5. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his · ta̍berna̍cle; * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up up·o̍n a ro̍ck of stone.
6. And now shall he li̍ft · up mine he̍ad * above mine enemies · ro̍und abo̍ut me.
7. Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, · wi̍th great gla̍dness: * I will sing, and speak praises · únto the̍ [[Lord]].
8. Hearken unto my voice, O [[Lord]], when I cry̍ · unto the̍e; * have mercy upo̍n · me, and he̍ar me.
9. My heart hath talked of thee, Se̍ek · ye my fa̍ce: * Thy face, · [[Lo̍rd]], will I̍ seek.
10. O hide not · tho̍u thy fa̍ce from me, * nor cast thy servant awa̍y · in disple̍asure.
11. Thou hast · be̍en my súccour; * leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of · my̍ salva̍tion.
12. When my father and my mo̍·ther forsa̍ke me, * the [[Lord]] · ta̍keth me̍ up.
13. Teach me thy · wa̍y, O [[Lo̍rd]], * and lead me in the right way, beca̍use · of mine e̍nemies.
14. Deliver me not over into the will of mine · a̍dversa̍ries: * for there are false witnesses risen up against me, and · súch as spe̍ak wrong.
15. I should útter·ly have fa̍inted, * but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the [[Lord]] in the la̍nd · of the li̍ving.

Unto thee will I cry̍, O · [[Lord]] my stre̍ngth: * think no scorn of me; lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go · do̍wn into̍ the pit.
2. Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry̍ · unto the̍e; * when I hold up my hands towards the mercy-seat of thy · ho̍ly te̍mple.
3. O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and · wi̍cked do̍ers, * which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mi̍s·chief in the̍ir hearts.
4. Reward them acco̍rding · to their de̍eds, * and according to the wickedness of their · o̍wn inve̍ntions.
5. Recompense them after the wo̍rk · of their ha̍nds; * pay them that they · ha̍ve dese̍rved.
6. For they regard not in their mind the works of the [[Lord]], nor the opera̍tion · of his ha̍nds; * therefore shall he break them down, · a̍nd not búild them up.
7. Pra̍ised · be the [[Lo̍rd]]; * for he hath heard the voice of my húm·ble peti̍tions.
8. The [[Lord]] is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and · I̍ am he̍lped; * therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song · wi̍ll I pra̍ise him.
9. The [[Lo̍rd]] · is my stre̍ngth, * and he is the wholesome defence of · hi̍s Ano̍inted.

Bring unto the [[Lord]], O ye mighty, bring young ra̍ms un·to the [[Lo̍rd]]; * ascribe unto the [[Lord]] · wo̍rship a̍nd strength.
2. Give the [[Lord]] the honour dúe un·to his Na̍me; * worship the [[Lord]] with · ho̍ly wo̍rship.

14. I became even as a · ma̍n that he̍areth not, * and in whose · mo̍uth are no̍ reproofs.
15. For in thee, O [[Lo̍rd]], have I · put my trúst; * thou shalt answer for · me̍, O Lo̍rd my God.
16. I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not · tri̍umph o̍ver me; * for when my foot slipped, they rejoiced gre̍at·ly aga̍inst me.
17. And I, truly, am se̍t · in the pla̍gue, * and my heaviness is e̍v·er in my̍ sight.
18. For I will con·fe̍ss my wi̍ckedness, * and be so̍r·ry for my̍ sin.
19. But mine enemies li̍ve, · and are mi̍ghty; * and they that hate me wrongfully are ma̍·ny in númber.
20. They also that reward evil for good · a̍re aga̍inst me; * because I follow the · thi̍ng that go̍od is.
21. Forsake me no̍t, O · [[Lord]] my Go̍d; * be · no̍t thou fa̍r from me.

I said, I will take he̍ed · to my wa̍ys, * that I of·fe̍nd not i̍n my tongue.
2. I will keep my mouth as it were · wi̍th a bri̍dle, * while the ungo̍d·ly is i̍n my sight.
3. I held my tongue, · a̍nd spake no̍thing: * I kept silence, yea, even from good words; but it was · pa̍in and gri̍ef to me.
4. My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing · the fi̍re ki̍ndled, * and at the last I · spa̍ke with my̍ tongue:
5. [[Lord]], let me know mine end, and the númber · of my da̍ys; * that I may be certified how · lo̍ng I ha̍ve to live.
6. Behold, thou hast made my days as it · we̍re a spa̍n long, * and mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is alto·ge̍ther va̍nity.
7. For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquiete̍th him·self in va̍in; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell · who̍ shall ga̍ther them.
8. And now, Lord, wha̍t · is my ho̍pe? * truly my hope is · e̍ven i̍n thee.
9. Deliver me from all · mi̍ne offe̍nces; * and make me not a rebuke un·to̍ the fo̍olish.
10. I became dumb, and o̍pened · not my mo̍uth; * for it · was thÿ do̍ing.
11. Take thy pla̍gue a·way from me̍: * I am even consumed by the me̍ans · of thy he̍avy hand.
12. When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fre̍t·ting a ga̍rment: * every man therefore · i̍s but va̍nity.
13. Hear my prayer, O [[Lord]], and with thine ears consi̍·der my ca̍lling; * hold not thy · pe̍ace at my̍ tears;
14. For I am a stranger with thee, · a̍nd a so̍journer, * as · a̍ll my fa̍thers were.
15. O spare me a little, that I may reco̍v·er my stre̍ngth, * before I go hence, and · be̍ no mo̍re seen.

\psalm{40}{Expectans expectavi.}
I waited pa̍tiently · for the [[Lo̍rd]], * and he inclined unto me, and · he̍ard my ca̍lling.
2. He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the · mi̍re and cla̍y, * and set my feet upon the rock, and order·e̍d my go̍ings.
3. And he hath put a new so̍ng · in my mo̍uth, * even a thanksgiving · únto o̍ur God.
4. Many shall se̍e · it, and fe̍ar, * and shall put their · trúst in the̍ [[Lord.]]
5. Blessed is the man that hath set his ho̍pe · in the [[Lo̍rd,]] * and turned not unto the proud, and to such as · go̍ abo̍ut with lies.
6. O [[Lord]] my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be also thy thoughts which · a̍re to ús-ward; * and yet there is no man that ordereth · the̍m unto̍ thee.
7. If I should decla̍re · them, and spe̍ak of them, * they should be more than I am · a̍ble to̍ express.
8. Sacrifice and meat-offering thou · wo̍uldest no̍t, * but mine e̍ars · hast thou o̍pened.
9. Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou · no̍t requi̍red: * then · sa̍id I, Lo̍, I come,
10. In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy wi̍ll, · O my Go̍d: * I am content to do it; yea, thy la̍w · is withi̍n my heart.
11. I have declared thy righteousness in the great · co̍ngrega̍tion: * lo, I will not refrain my lips, O [[Lord]], and · tha̍t thou kno̍west.
12. I have not hid thy righteousne̍ss with·in my he̍art; * my talk hath been of thy truth and of · thy̍ salva̍tion.
13. I have not kept back thy loving me̍r·cy and trúth * from the great · co̍ngrega̍tion.
14. Withdraw not thou thy mercy fro̍m · me, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * let thy loving-kindness and thy truth a̍l·way prese̍rve me.
15. For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon me, that I am not a̍ble · to look úp; * yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my · he̍art hath fa̍iled me.
16. O [[Lord]], let it be thy pleasure · to̍ deli̍ver me; * make haste, O · [[Lo̍rd]], to he̍lp me.

17. Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my so̍ul · to destro̍y it; * let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that · wi̍sh me e̍vil.
18. Let them be desolate, and rewa̍rd·ed with sha̍me, * that say unto me, Fie upon thee! · fi̍e upo̍n thee!
19. Let all those that seek thee be jo̍y·ful and gla̍d in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation say alway, The · [[Lo̍rd]] be pra̍ised.
20. As for me, I am · po̍or and ne̍edy; * but the Lord · ca̍reth fo̍r me.
21. Thou art my helper · a̍nd rede̍emer; * make no long ta̍r·rying, O̍ my God.

3. The [[Lord]] comfort him, when he lieth si̍ck up·on his be̍d; * make thou all his be̍d · in his si̍ckness.
4. I said, [[Lord]], be me̍rciful · unto me̍; * heal my soul, for I have si̍n·ned aga̍inst thee.
5. Mine enemies speak e̍·vil of me̍, * When shall he die, and · his näme pe̍rish?
6. And if he come to see me, he · spe̍aketh va̍nity, * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself, and when he cometh · fo̍rth he te̍lleth it.
7. All mine enemies whisper to·ge̍ther aga̍inst me; * even against me do they ima̍·gine this e̍vil.

Like as the hart desi̍r·eth the wa̍ter-brooks, * so longeth my soul · a̍fter the̍e, O God.
2. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even · fo̍r the li̍ving God: * when shall I come to appear before the · pre̍sence o̍f God?
3. My tears have been my me̍at · day and ni̍ght, * while they daily say unto me, · Whe̍re is no̍w thy God?

We have heard with our ears, O God, our fa̍·thers have to̍ld us * what thou hast do̍ne · in their ti̍me of old:
2. How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and pla̍nt·ed them i̍n; * how thou hast destroyed the na̍·tions, and ca̍st them out.
3. For they gat not the land in possession thro̍ugh · their own swo̍rd, * neither was it their own · a̍rm that he̍lped them;
4. But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the li̍ght · of thy co̍untenance; * because thou hadst a · fa̍vour únto them.
5. Thou a̍rt my · King, O Go̍d; * send he̍lp · unto Ja̍cob.
6. Through thee will we over·thro̍w our e̍nemies, * and in thy Name will we tread them under, that rise · úp aga̍inst us.
7. For I will not trúst · in my bo̍w, * it is not my swo̍rd · that shall he̍lp me;
8. But it is thou that savest us · fro̍m our e̍nemies, * and puttest them to confú·sion that ha̍te us.
9. We make our boast of Go̍d · all day lo̍ng, * and will praise thy · Na̍me for e̍ver.
10. But now thou art far off, and puttest us · to̍ confúsion, * and goest not fo̍rth · with our a̍rmies.
11. Thou makest us to turn our backs up·o̍n our e̍nemies, * so that they which · ha̍te us spo̍il our goods.
12. Thou lettest us be e̍aten · up like she̍ep, * and hast scattered us a·mo̍ng the he̍athen.
13. Thou sellest thy pe̍o·ple for no̍ught, * and takest no · mo̍ney fo̍r them.
14. Thou makest us to be rebuked · o̍f our ne̍ighbours, * to be laughed to scorn, and had in derision of them that are · ro̍und abo̍ut us.
15. Thou makest us to be a by-word a·mo̍ng the he̍athen, * and that the people · sha̍ke their he̍ads at us.
16. My confusion is da̍i·ly befo̍re me, * and the shame of my face hath · co̍vere̍d me;
17. For the voice of the slanderer a̍nd blasphe̍mer, * for the enemy · a̍nd ave̍nger.
18. And though all this be come upon us, yet do we · no̍t forge̍t thee, * nor behave ourselves frowardly · i̍n thy co̍venant.
19. Our heart i̍s not · turned ba̍ck, * neither our steps gone · o̍ut of thy̍ way;
20. No, not when thou hast smitten us into the · pla̍ce of dra̍gons, * and covered us with the · sha̍dow o̍f death.
21. If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to · a̍ny stra̍nge god, * shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very · se̍crets o̍f the heart.
22. For thy sake also are we killed all · the day lo̍ng, * and are counted as sheep ap·po̍inted to̍ be slain.
23. Up, · Lo̍rd, why sle̍epest thou? * awake, and be not absent from · ús for e̍ver.
24. Wherefore hi̍dest · thou thy fa̍ce, * and forgettest our mise·ry̍ and tro̍uble?
25. For our soul is brought low, even ún·to the dúst; * our belly cleav·eth únto̍ the ground.

5. Good luck have thou · wi̍th thine ho̍nour: * ride on, because of the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee · te̍rrible̍ things.
6. Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be sub·dúed únto thee, * even in the midst among · the Kïng’s e̍nemies.
7. Thy seat, O God, endúr·eth for e̍ver; * the sceptre of thy kingdom is · a rïght sce̍ptre.
8. Thou hast loved righteousness, and ha̍·ted ini̍quity; * wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness a·bo̍ve thy fe̍llows.
9. All thy garments smell of myrrh, a̍·loes, and ca̍ssia; * out of the ivory palaces, whereby · the̍y have ma̍de thee glad.
10. Kings’ daughters were among thy honour·a̍ble wo̍men; * upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with · di̍vers co̍lours.
11. Hearken, O daughter, and consider; inc·li̍ne thine e̍ar; * forget also thine own people, · a̍nd thy fa̍ther’s house.

10. For he seeth that wise men also die, and pe̍r·ish toge̍ther, * as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their ri̍ch·es for o̍ther.
11. And yet they think that their houses shall conti̍n·ue for e̍ver, * and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the lands a̍f·ter their o̍wn names.
12. Nevertheless, man will not a·bi̍de in ho̍nour, * seeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish; thi̍s · is the wa̍y of them.

18. O be favourable and gracious · únto Sy̍on; * build thou the wa̍lls · of Hierúsalem.

4. Thou hast loved unrighteousness · mo̍re than go̍odness, * and to talk of li̍es · more than ri̍ghteousness.
5. Thou hast loved to speak all wo̍rds that · may do húrt, * – · O̍ thou fa̍lse tongue.

4. My heart is disqui̍et·ed withi̍n me, * and the fear of death is fa̍ll·en upo̍n me.
5. Fearfulness and trembling are · co̍me upo̍n me, * and an horrible dread hath · o̍verwhe̍lmed me.

9. For thou, O · Go̍d, hast pro̍ved us; * thou also hast tried us, like as si̍l·ver is tri̍ed.
10. Thou broughtest us i̍n·to the sna̍re; * and laidest tro̍u·ble upo̍n our loins.
11. Thou sufferedst men to ride o̍·ver our he̍ads; * we went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us out in·to̍ a we̍althy place.
12. I will go into thine house · wi̍th burnt-o̍fferings, * and will pay thee my vows, which I promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I · wa̍s in tro̍uble.
13. I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the i̍n·cense of ra̍ms; * I will offer · búllocks a̍nd goats.
14. O come hither, and hearken, all · ye̍ that fe̍ar God; * and I will tell you what he hath · do̍ne for my̍ soul.
15. I called unto hi̍m · with my mo̍uth, * and gave him · pra̍ises wi̍th my tongue.
16. If I incline unto wi̍ckedness · with mine he̍art, * the Lo̍rd · will not he̍ar me.
17. But · Go̍d hath he̍ard me; * and considered the · vo̍ice of my̍ prayer.
18. Praised be God, who hath not ca̍st · out my pra̍yer, * nor turned his · me̍rcy fro̍m me.

5. Let the people pra̍ise · thee, O Go̍d; * let all the · pe̍ople pra̍ise thee.

Let God arise, and let his ene·mi̍es be sca̍ttered; * let them also that hate him · fle̍e befo̍re him.
2. Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou dri̍ve · them awa̍y; * and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the · pre̍sence o̍f God.
3. But let the righteous be glad and rejo̍ice · before Go̍d; * let them also be me̍r·ry and jo̍yful.
4. O sing unto God, and sing praises ún·to his Na̍me; * magnify him that rideth upon the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name [[Jah]], and re·jo̍ice befo̍re him.
5. He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the ca̍use · of the wi̍dows; * even God in his holy · ha̍bita̍tion.
6. He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the prisoners o̍ut · of capti̍vity; * but letteth the runagates conti̍·nue in sca̍rceness.
7. O God, when thou wentest forth be·fo̍re the pe̍ople; * when thou wentest · thro̍ugh the wi̍lderness;
8. The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the pre̍·sence of Go̍d; * even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, who is the · Go̍d of I̍srael.
9. Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon · thi̍ne inhe̍ritance, * and refreshedst it when · i̍t was we̍ary.
10. Thy congregation shall · dwe̍ll therei̍n; * for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness pre·pa̍red fo̍r the poor.
11. The Lo̍rd · gave the wo̍rd; * great was the company · o̍f the pre̍achers.
12. Kings with their armies did flee, and · we̍re disco̍mfited, * and they of the household di·vi̍ded the̍ spoil.
13. Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wi̍ngs · of a do̍ve * that is covered with silver wings, and her · fe̍athers li̍ke gold.

17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even tho̍u·sands of a̍ngels; * and the Lord is among them, as in the holy · pla̍ce of Si̍nai.
18. Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and rece̍ived · gifts for me̍n; * yea, even for thine enemies, that the [[Lord]] God might · dwe̍ll amo̍ng them.
19. Praised be · the Lo̍rd da̍ily, * even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his bene·fi̍ts upo̍n us.
20. He is our God, even the God of whom co̍·meth salva̍tion: * [[God]] is the Lord, by who̍m · we esca̍pe death.
21. God shall wound the he̍ad · of his e̍nemies, * and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on sti̍ll · in his wi̍ckedness.
22. The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I · di̍d from Ba̍san; * mine own will I bring again, as I did sometime from the · de̍ep of the̍ sea.
23. That thy foot may be dipped in the blo̍od · of thine e̍nemies, * and that the tongue of thy dogs may · be rëd thro̍ugh the same.
24. It is well seen, O God, · ho̍w thou go̍est; * how thou, my God and King, goest in the · sa̍nctua̍ry.
25. The singers go before, the minstrels · fo̍llow a̍fter, * in the midst are the damsels playing · wi̍th the ti̍mbrels.
26. Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the · co̍ngrega̍tions, * from the · gro̍und of the he̍art.
27. There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Jú·dah their co̍unsel; * the princes of Zabulon, and the pri̍n·ces of Ne̍phthali.
28. Thy God hath · se̍nt forth stre̍ngth for thee; * stablish the thing, O God, that · tho̍u hast wro̍ught in us,
29. For thy temple’s sa̍ke · at Jerúsalem; * so shall kings bring · pre̍sents únto thee.
30. When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pi̍e·ces of si̍lver; * and when he hath scattered the people · tha̍t deli̍ght in war;
31. Then shall the princes come · o̍ut of E̍gypt; * the Morians’ land shall soon stretch our her · ha̍nds unto̍ God.

3. I am weary of cry̍ing; my · throat is dry̍; * my sight faileth me for waiting so · lo̍ng upo̍n my God.
4. They that hate me without a cause are more than the ha̍irs · of my he̍ad; * they that are mine enemies, and would destroy me gúilt·less, are mi̍ghty.

6. Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord [[God]] of hosts, be asha̍med · for my ca̍use; * let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord · Go̍d of I̍srael.

19. Draw nigh unto my · so̍ul, and sa̍ve it; * O deliver me, beca̍use · of mine e̍nemies.
20. Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and · my̍ disho̍nour: * mine adversaries are · a̍ll in thy̍ sight.
21. Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am · fúll of he̍aviness: * I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I a̍·ny to co̍mfort me.

Truly God is loving · únto I̍srael: * even unto such as are · o̍f a cle̍an heart.
2. Nevertheless, my fe̍et were · almost go̍ne, * my tre̍ad·ings had we̍ll-nigh slipt.
3. And why? I was grieved · a̍t the wi̍cked: * I do also see the ungodly in · súch prospe̍rity.
4. For they are in no pe̍·ril of de̍ath; * but are · lústy a̍nd strong.
5. They come in no misfo̍rtune like · other fo̍lk; * neither are they pla̍·gued like o̍ther men.
6. And this is the cause that they are so ho̍ld·en with pri̍de, * and overwhe̍lm·ed with crúelty.
7. Their eyes · swe̍ll with fa̍tness, * and they do · e̍ven wha̍t they lust.
8. They corrupt other, and speak of · wi̍cked bla̍sphemy; * their talking is a·ga̍inst the Mo̍st High.
9. For they stretch forth their mouth un·to̍ the he̍aven, * and their tongue · go̍eth thro̍ugh the world.
10. Therefore fall the · pe̍ople únto them, * and thereout suck they no · sma̍ll adva̍ntage.
11. Tush, say they, how should · Go̍d perce̍ive it? * is there knowledge · i̍n the Mo̍st High?
12. Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches · i̍n posse̍ssion: * and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed mine hands in · i̍nnoce̍ncy.
13. All the day long have · I̍ been púnished, * and chastened · e̍very mo̍rning.
14. Yea, and I had almost said e̍·ven as the̍y; * but lo, then I should have condemned the generation · o̍f thy chi̍ldren.
15. Then thought I to · úndersta̍nd this; * but i̍t · was too ha̍rd for me,
16. Until I went into the sanctua̍·ry of Go̍d: * then understood I the · e̍nd of the̍se men;
17. Namely, how thou dost set them in sli̍p·pery pla̍ces, * and castest them do̍wn, · and destro̍yest them.
18. O how suddenly do̍ · they consúme, * perish, and co̍me · to a fe̍arful end!
19. Yea, even like as a dream when · o̍ne awa̍keth; * so shalt thou make their image to vanish o̍ut · of the ci̍ty.
20. Thus my · he̍art was gri̍eved, * and it went · e̍ven thro̍ugh my reins.
21. So foolish was · I̍, and i̍gnorant, * even as it were a · be̍ast befo̍re thee.
22. Nevertheless, I am a̍l·way by the̍e; * for thou hast holden me · by̍ my ri̍ght hand.
23. Thou shalt guide me · wi̍th thy co̍unsel, * and after that rece̍ive · me with glo̍ry.
24. Whom have I in he̍a·ven but the̍e? * and there is none upon earth that I desire in compa̍·rison o̍f thee.
25. My flesh and · my he̍art fa̍ileth; * but God is the strength of my heart, and my po̍r·tion for e̍ver.
26. For lo, they that forsake · the̍e shall pe̍rish; * thou hast destroyed all them that commit fornica̍·tion aga̍inst thee.
27. But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trúst in · the Lord [[Go̍d]], * and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the da̍ugh·ter of Sy̍on.

3. Think upon the tribe of · thi̍ne inhe̍ritance, * and mount Syon, where·i̍n thou ha̍st dwelt.
4. Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy e̍v·ery e̍nemy, * which hath done evil in thy · sa̍nctua̍ry.
5. Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy · co̍ngrega̍tions, * and set up their ba̍n·ners for to̍kens.
6. He that hewed timber afore o̍ut of · the thick tre̍es, * was known to bring it to an · e̍xcelle̍nt work.
7. But now they break down all the ca̍rved · work thereo̍f * with a̍x·es and ha̍mmers.
8. They have set fire upon thy · ho̍ly pla̍ces, * and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name, even · únto the̍ ground.
9. Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havock of them · a̍ltoge̍ther: * thus have they burnt up all the houses · of Göd i̍n the land.
10. We see not our tokens; there is no̍t one · prophet mo̍re; * no, not one is there among us, that under·sta̍ndeth a̍ny more.
11. O God, how long shall the adversary do · thi̍s disho̍nour? * how long shall the enemy blaspheme thy · Na̍me, for e̍ver?
12. Why withdra̍west · thou thy ha̍nd? * why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to con·súme the e̍nemy?
13. For Go̍d is my · King of o̍ld; * the help that is done upon earth, he · do̍eth i̍t himself.
14. Thou didst divide the sea · thro̍ugh thy po̍wer; * thou brakest the heads of the dragons · i̍n the wa̍ters.
15. Thou smotest the heads of Levia·tha̍n in pi̍eces, * and gavest him to be meat for the people · i̍n the wi̍lderness.
16. Thou broughtest out fountains and waters o̍ut of · the hard ro̍cks; * thou driedst up · mi̍ghty wa̍ters.
17. The day is thi̍ne, and the · night is thi̍ne; * thou hast prepared the · li̍ght and the̍ sun.
18. Thou hast set all the bo̍rders · of the e̍arth; * thou hast made súm·mer and wi̍nter.
19. Remember this, O [[Lord]], how the enemy · ha̍th rebúked; * and how the foolish people hath blasphe̍med thy̍ Name.
20. O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude · o̍f the e̍nemies; * and forget not the congregation of the · po̍or for e̍ver.
21. Look up·o̍n the Co̍venant; * for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel · ha̍bita̍tions.
22. O let not the simple go a·wa̍y asha̍med; * but let the poor and needy give praise · únto thy̍ Name.
23. Arise, O God, mainta̍in · thine own ca̍use; * remember how the foolish man blasphe̍m·eth thee da̍ily.

In Je̍wry · is God kno̍wn; * his Name is · gre̍at in I̍srael.

3. There brake he the a̍rrows · of the bo̍w, * the shield, the swo̍rd, · and the ba̍ttle.
4. Thou art of more ho̍·nour and mi̍ght, * than the hi̍lls · of the ro̍bbers.
5. The proud are robbed, the̍y have · slept their sle̍ep; * and all the men whose hands were mighty · have föund no̍thing.

7. Thou, even thou art · to̍ be fe̍ared; * and who may stand in thy sight when · tho̍u art a̍ngry?

10. The fierceness of man shall túrn · to thy pra̍ise; * and the fierceness of · the̍m shalt tho̍u refrain.

\psalm{77}{Voce mea ad Dominum.}
I will cry unto Go̍d · with my vo̍ice; * even unto God will I cry with my voice, and he shall · he̍arken únto me.

3. When I am in heaviness, I will thi̍nk · upon Go̍d; * when my heart is ve̍x·ed, I wi̍ll complain.
4. Thou holdest · mi̍ne eyes wa̍king: * I am so feeble, · tha̍t I ca̍nnot speak.
5. I have considere̍d the · days of o̍ld, * and the · ye̍ars that a̍re past.
6. I call to reme̍m·brance my so̍ng, * and in the night I commune with mine own heart, and search · o̍ut my spi̍rits.
7. Will the Lord absent him·se̍lf for e̍ver? * and will he be no · mo̍re intre̍ated?
8. Is his mercy clean · go̍ne for e̍ver? * and is his promise come utterly to an · e̍nd for e̍vermore?
9. Hath God forgotten · to̍ be gra̍cious? * and will he shut up his loving-kindness · i̍n disple̍asure?
10. And I said, It is mine · o̍wn infi̍rmity; * but I will remember the years of the right hand of · the Möst Hi̍ghest.
11. I will remember the wo̍rks · of the [[Lo̍rd]], * and call to mind thy wo̍n·ders of o̍ld time.

\psalm{78}{Attendite, popule.}
Hear my law, · O̍ my pe̍ople, * incline your ears unto the · wo̍rds of my̍ mouth.
2. I will open my mo̍uth · in a pa̍rable; * I will declare hard · se̍ntence̍s of old;
3. Which we̍ have · heard and kno̍wn; * and such as our fa̍·thers have to̍ld us;
4. That we should not hide them from the children of the genera̍·tions to co̍me; * but to shew the honour of the [[Lord]], his mighty and wonderful · wo̍rks that he̍ hath done.
5. He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave I̍sra·el a la̍w, * which he commanded our forefathers to · te̍ach their chi̍ldren;
6. That their poste̍ri·ty might kno̍w it, * and the children · whi̍ch were ye̍t unborn;
7. To the intent that whe̍n · they came úp, * they might shew their · chi̍ldren the̍ same;
8. That they might pút their · trust in Go̍d * and not to forget the works of God, but to ke̍ep · his comma̍ndments;
9. And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn · ge̍nera̍tion; * a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not sted·fa̍stly únto God;
10. Like as the chi̍l·dren of E̍phraym; * who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in the · da̍y of ba̍ttle.
11. They kept not the co̍ve·nant of Go̍d, * and would not · wa̍lk in hi̍s law;
12. But forga̍t what · he had do̍ne, * and the wonderful works that he had · she̍wed fo̍r them.
13. Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the · la̍nd of E̍gypt, * even in the · fi̍eld of Zo̍an.
14. He divided the sea, and le̍t · them go thro̍ugh; * he made the waters to · sta̍nd on a̍n heap.
15. In the day-time also he le̍d them · with a clo̍ud, * and all the night thro̍ugh · with a li̍ght of fire.
16. He clave the hard ro̍cks · in the wi̍lderness, * and gave them drink thereof, as it had been o̍ut · of the gre̍at depth.
17. He brought waters o̍ut of the · stony ro̍ck, * so that it gushed out · li̍ke the ri̍vers.
18. Yet for all this they sinned · mo̍re aga̍inst him, * and provoked the most Highest · i̍n the wi̍lderness.
19. They tempted Go̍d · in their he̍arts, * and required · me̍at for the̍ir lust.
20. They spake against God · a̍lso, sa̍ying, * Shall God prepare a table · i̍n the wi̍lderness?
21. He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams flo̍w·ed witha̍l; * but can he give bread also, or provide fle̍sh · for his pe̍ople?
22. When the [[Lord]] he̍ard this, · he was wro̍th; * so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure · agäinst I̍srael;
23. Because they beli̍eved · not in Go̍d, * and put not their · trúst in hi̍s help.
24. So he comma̍nded the · clouds abo̍ve, * and opened the · do̍ors of he̍aven.
25. He rained down manna also upo̍n them · for to e̍at, * and gave them · fo̍od from he̍aven.
26. So ma̍n did eat · angels’ fo̍od; * for he · se̍nt them me̍at enough.
27. He caused the east-wind to blow · únder he̍aven; * and through his power he bro̍ught · in the so̍uthwest-wind.
28. He rained flesh upo̍n them as · thick as dúst, * and feathered fowls like as the · sa̍nd of the̍ sea.
29. He let it fa̍ll a·mong their te̍nts, * even round about their · ha̍bita̍tion.
30. So they did eat and were well filled, for he ga̍ve them their · own desi̍re: * they were not disappo̍int·ed of the̍ir lust.
31. But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the we̍althi·est of the̍m; * yea, and smote down the chosen men that · we̍re in I̍srael.
32. But for all this they si̍n·ned yet mo̍re, * and believed · no̍t his wo̍ndrous works.
33. Therefore their days did he con·súme in va̍nity, * and their · ye̍ars in tro̍uble.
34. When he sle̍w · them, they so̍ught him, * and turned them early, and in·qui̍red a̍fter God.
35. And they remembered that Go̍d · was their stre̍ngth, * and that the high God was · the̍ir rede̍emer.
36. Nevertheless, they did but fla̍tter him · with their mo̍uth, * and dissembled · wi̍th him i̍n their tongue.
37. For their heart · wa̍s not who̍le with him, * neither continued they stedfast · i̍n his co̍venant.
38. But he was so merciful, that he forga̍ve · their misde̍eds, * and de·stro̍yed the̍m not.
39. Yea, many a time turned he̍ his · wrath awa̍y, * and would not suffer his whole dis·ple̍asure to̍ arise.
40. For he considered that the̍y · were but fle̍sh, * and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and · co̍meth no̍t again.
41. Many a time did they provoke him · i̍n the wi̍lderness, * and grieved him · i̍n the de̍sert.
42. They turned ba̍ck, and · tempted Go̍d, * and moved the Holy · O̍ne in I̍srael.
43. They tho̍ught not · of his ha̍nd, * and of the day when he delivered them from the ha̍nd · of the e̍nemy;
44. How he had wrought his mira·cle̍s in E̍gypt, * and his wonders in the · fi̍eld of Zo̍an.
45. He turned their wa̍ters · into blo̍od, * so that they might not dri̍nk · of the ri̍vers.
46. He sent lice among them, and devo̍ur·ed them úp; * and fro̍gs · to destro̍y them.
47. He gave their fruit unto the · ca̍terpi̍llar, * and their labour unto · the grässho̍pper.
48. He destroyed their · vi̍nes with ha̍il-stones, * and their mulberry-·tre̍es with the̍ frost.
49. He smote their cattle a̍l·so with ha̍il-stones, * and their flo̍cks · with hot thúnderbolts.
50. He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, dis·ple̍asure and tro̍uble: * and sent evil a̍n·gels amo̍ng them.
51. He made a way to his indignation, and spared no̍t their · soul from de̍ath; * but gave their life over · to̍ the pe̍stilence;
52. And smote all the fi̍rst-·born in E̍gypt, * the most principal and mightiest in the · dwe̍llings o̍f Ham.
53. But as for his own people, he le̍d them · forth like she̍ep, * and carried them in the wi̍l·derness li̍ke a flock.
54. He brought them out safely, tha̍t they · should not fe̍ar, * and overwhelmed their e̍n·emies wi̍th the sea.
55. And brought them within the borders of his · sa̍nctua̍ry, * even to his mountain which he purchased · wi̍th his ri̍ght hand.
56. He cast out the heathen a̍l·so befo̍re them, * caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to · dwe̍ll in the̍ir tents.
57. So they tempted and disple̍ased the · Most High Go̍d, * and kept not his · te̍stimo̍nies;
58. But turned their backs, and fell away like · the̍ir forefa̍thers; * starting aside · li̍ke a bro̍ken bow.
59. For they grieved him with · the̍ir hill-a̍ltars, * and provoked him to displeasure · wi̍th their i̍mages.
60. When God he̍ard this, · he was wro̍th, * and took sore disple̍a·sure at I̍srael.
61. So that he forsook the taberna̍·cle in Sy̍lo, * even the tent that he had pi̍tch·ed amo̍ng men.
62. He delivered their power i̍n·to capti̍vity, * and their beauty into the · e̍nemi̍es’ hand.
63. He gave his people over also ún·to the swo̍rd, * and was wroth with · hi̍s inhe̍ritance.
64. The fire consú·med their yo̍ung men, * and their maidens were not gi̍v·en to ma̍rriage.
65. Their priests were sla̍in · with the swo̍rd, * and there were no widows to make · la̍menta̍tion.
66. So the Lord awaked as o̍ne · out of sle̍ep, * and like a giant re·fre̍shed wi̍th wine.
67. He smote his enemies i̍n the · hinder pa̍rts, * and put them to a per·pe̍tua̍l shame.
68. He refused the taberna̍·cle of Jo̍seph, * and chose not the · tri̍be of E̍phraym;
69. But chose the · tri̍be of Iúdah, * even the hill of Syon · whi̍ch he lo̍ved.
70. And there he built his te̍m·ple on hi̍gh, * and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath · ma̍de conti̍nually.
71. He chose David a̍l·so his se̍rvant, * and took him awa̍y · from the she̍ep-folds.
72. As he was following the ewes great with yo̍ung · ones he to̍ok him, * that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel · hi̍s inhe̍ritance.
73. So he fed them with a fa̍ithful · and true he̍art, * and ruled them prudently with · a̍ll his po̍wer.

O God, the heathen are come into · thi̍ne inhe̍ritance; * thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusa·le̍m an he̍ap of stones.
2. The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fo̍wls · of the a̍ir, * and the flesh of thy saints unto the · be̍asts of the̍ land.
3. Their blood have they shed like water on every si̍de · of Jerúsalem, * and there was no̍ · man to búry them.
4. We are become an open sha̍me · to our e̍nemies, * a very scorn and derision unto them that are · ro̍und abo̍ut us.
5. [[Lord]], how long wilt · tho̍u be a̍ngry? * shall thy jealousy burn like · fi̍re for e̍ver?
6. Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that · ha̍ve not kno̍wn thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not ca̍l·led upo̍n thy Name.
7. For they have de·vo̍ured Ja̍cob, * and laid · wa̍ste his dwe̍lling-place.
8. O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upo̍n us, · and that so̍on; * for we are co̍me · to great mi̍sery.
9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glo̍ry · of thy Na̍me: * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, · fo̍r thy Na̍me’s sake.
10. Wherefore do̍ the · heathen sa̍y, * – · Whe̍re is no̍w their God?
11. O let the vengeance of thy servants’ blo̍od · that is she̍d, * be openly shewed upon the he̍a·then in o̍ur sight.
12. O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners · co̍me befo̍re thee; * according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are ap·po̍inted to̍ die.
13. And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours ha̍ve blas·phemed the̍e, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold in·to̍ their bo̍som.
14. So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee · tha̍nks for e̍ver, * and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to · ge̍nera̍tion.

3. Túrn us a·gain, O Go̍d; * shew the light of thy countenance, and · we̍ shall be̍ whole.
4. O [[Lo̍rd]] · God of ho̍sts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy pe̍o·ple that pra̍yeth?
5. Thou feedest them wi̍th the · bread of te̍ars, * and givest them plenteous·ne̍ss of te̍ars to drink.
6. Thou hast made us a very strife ún·to our ne̍ighbours, * and our enemies · la̍ugh us to̍ scorn.
7. Turn us aga̍in, thou · God of ho̍sts; * shew the light of thy countenance, and · we̍ shall be̍ whole.
8. Thou hast brought a vine · o̍ut of E̍gypt; * thou hast cast out the he̍a·then, and pla̍nted it.
9. Thou · ma̍dest ro̍om for it; * and when it had taken root it · fi̍lled the̍ land.
10. The hills were covered with the sha̍·dow of i̍t, * and the boughs thereof were like the · go̍odly ce̍dar-trees.
11. She stretched out her branches ún·to the se̍a, * and her boughs un·to̍ the ri̍ver.
12. Why hast thou then bro̍ken · down her he̍dge, * that all they that go · by̍ pluck o̍ff her grapes?
13. The wild boar out of the wo̍od doth · root it úp, * and the wild beasts of the · fi̍eld devo̍ur it.

17. Let thy hand be upon the ma̍n of · thy right ha̍nd, * and upon the son of man, whom thou madest so strong · fo̍r thine o̍wn self.
18. And so will not we̍ go · back from the̍e: * O let us live, and we shall ca̍ll · upon thy̍ Name.

4. For this was made a sta̍·tute for I̍srael, * and a law of the · Go̍d of Ja̍cob.
5. This he ordained in Joseph for a · te̍stimo̍ny, * when he came out of the land of Egypt, and had heard · a stränge la̍nguage.
6. I eased his shoulder · fro̍m the búrden, * and his hands were delivered from · ma̍king the̍ pots.
7. Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I deli̍v·ered the̍e; * and heard thee what time as the storm · fe̍ll upo̍n thee.

12. But my people wo̍uld not · hear my vo̍ice; * and Israel would · no̍t obe̍y me.
13. So I gave them up únto their · own hearts’ lústs, * and let them follow their own i·ma̍gina̍tions.
14. O that my people would have he̍arkened · unto me̍! * for if Israel had wa̍lk·ed in my̍ ways,
15. I should soon have put · do̍wn their e̍nemies, * and turned my hand against their · a̍dversa̍ries.
16. The haters of the [[Lord]] should have · be̍en found li̍ars; * but their time should have endúr·ed for e̍ver.

Bow down thine ear, O · [[Lo̍rd]], and he̍ar me; * for I am po̍or, · and in mi̍sery.
2. Preserve thou my soul, for · I̍ am ho̍ly: * my God, save thy servant that pút·teth his trúst in thee.
3. Be merciful únto · me, O Lo̍rd; * for I will call da̍i·ly upo̍n thee.
4. Comfort the so̍ul · of thy se̍rvant; * for unto thee, O Lord, do I · li̍ft up my̍ soul.
5. For thou, Lord, art · go̍od and gra̍cious, * and of great mercy unto all them that · ca̍ll upo̍n thee.
6. Give ear, [[Lord]], ún·to my pra̍yer, * and ponder the voice of my · húmble de̍sires.
7. In the time of my trouble I will · ca̍ll upo̍n thee; * – · fo̍r thou he̍arest me.
8. Among the gods there is none like únto · thee, O Lo̍rd; * there is not one that can · do̍ as tho̍u doest.
9. All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and wo̍rship · thee, O Lo̍rd; * and shall glo̍·rify thy̍ Name.
10. For thou art great, and do̍est · wondrous thi̍ngs: * – · tho̍u art Go̍d alone.
11. Teach me thy way, O [[Lord]], and I will wa̍lk · in thy trúth: * O knit my heart unto thee, that · I̍ may fe̍ar thy Name.
12. I will thank thee, O Lord my Go̍d, with · all my he̍art; * and will praise thy · Na̍me for e̍vermore.
13. For great is thy me̍r·cy towa̍rd me; * and thou hast delivered my soul from the · ne̍thermo̍st hell.
14. O God, the proud are ri̍·sen aga̍inst me; * and the congregations of naughty men have sought after my soul, and have not se̍t · thee befo̍re their eyes.
15. But thou, O Lord God, art full of compa̍s·sion and me̍rcy, * long-suffering, plenteous in · go̍odness a̍nd truth.
16. O turn thee then unto me, and have me̍r·cy upo̍n me; * give thy strength unto thy servant, and help the so̍n · of thine ha̍ndmaid.
17. Shew some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see it, and · be̍ asha̍med, * because thou, [[Lord]], hast holpen me and · co̍mforte̍d me.


\psalm{87}{Fundamenta ejus.}
Her foundations are upo̍n the · holy hi̍lls: * the [[Lord]] loveth the gates of Syon more than all the dwe̍ll·ings of Ja̍cob.
2. Very excellent things are spo̍·ken of the̍e, * thou · ci̍ty o̍f God.
3. I will think upon Ra̍·hab and Ba̍bylon, * with · the̍m that kno̍w me.
4. Behold ye the Phi̍·listines a̍lso; * and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, · the̍re was he̍ born.
5. And of Syon it shall be reported that · he̍ was bo̍rn in her; * and the most · Hi̍gh shall sta̍blish her.
6. The [[Lord]] shall rehearse it, when he writeth · úp the pe̍ople; * that · he̍ was bo̍rn there.
7. The singers also and trumpeters sha̍ll · he rehe̍arse: * All my fresh · spri̍ngs shall be̍ in thee.


\psalm{88}{Domine Deus.}
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and · ni̍ght befo̍re thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear un·to̍ my ca̍lling.
2. For my soul is · fúll of tro̍uble, * and my life draweth · ni̍gh unto̍ hell.
3. I am counted as one of them that go do̍wn in·to the pi̍t, * and I have been even as a · ma̍n that ha̍th no strength.
4. Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and li̍e · in the gra̍ve, * who are out of remembrance, and are cut a·wa̍y from thy̍ hand.
5. Thou hast laid me i̍n the · lowest pi̍t, * in a place of da̍rk·ness, and i̍n the deep.
6. Thine indignation lieth · ha̍rd upo̍n me, * and thou hast vexed · me̍ with a̍ll thy storms.
7. Thou hast put away mine ac·qua̍intance fa̍r from me, * and made me to be ab·ho̍rred o̍f them.
8. I am so · fa̍st in pri̍son * that I · ca̍nnot ge̍t forth.
9. My sight faileth for · ve̍ry tro̍uble; * [[Lord]], I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched forth my · ha̍nds unto̍ thee.
10. Dost thou shew wo̍nders a·mong the de̍ad? * or shall the dead rise up a·ga̍in, and pra̍ise thee?
11. Shall thy loving-kindness be she̍wed · in the gra̍ve? * or thy faithfulness · i̍n destrúction?
12. Shall thy wondrous works be kno̍wn · in the da̍rk? * and thy righteousness in the land where all things · a̍re forgo̍tten?
13. Unto thee have I cri̍·ed, O [[Lo̍rd]]; * and early shall my prayer · co̍me befo̍re thee.
14. [[Lord]], why abho̍rrest · thou my so̍ul, * and hidest · tho̍u thy fa̍ce from me?
15. I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the · po̍int to di̍e; * even from my youth up thy terrors have I suffered · wi̍th a tro̍ubled mind.
16. Thy wrathful displeasure · go̍eth o̍ver me, * and the fear of thee · ha̍th undo̍ne me.
17. They came round about me da̍i·ly like wa̍ter, * and compassed me toge̍·ther on e̍very side.
18. My lovers and friends hast thou · pút awa̍y from me, * and hid mine acquaintance · o̍ut of my̍ sight.

\psalterday{17}{Evening}
\psalm{89}{Misericordias Domini.} 
My song shall be alway of the loving-ki̍ndness · of the [[Lo̍rd]]; * with my mouth will I ever be shewing thy truth from one generation · to̍ ano̍ther.
2. For I have said, Mercy shall be set · úp for e̍ver; * thy truth shalt thou stablish · i̍n the he̍avens.
3. I have made a covenant · wi̍th my cho̍sen; * I have sworn unto Da̍·vid my se̍rvant;
4. Thy seed will I sta̍b·lish for e̍ver, * and set up thy throne from one generation · to̍ ano̍ther.
5. O [[Lord]], the very heavens shall pra̍ise thy · wondrous wo̍rks; * and thy truth in the congre·ga̍tion o̍f the saints.
6. For who is he̍ a·mong the clo̍uds, * that shall be compa̍r·ed unto̍ the [[Lord]]?
7. And what is he̍ a·mong the go̍ds, * that shall be · li̍ke unto̍ the [[Lord]]?
8. God is very greatly to be feared in the co̍uncil · of the sa̍ints, * and to be had in reverence of all them that are · ro̍und abo̍ut him.
9. O [[Lord]] God of hosts, who is li̍ke · unto the̍e? * thy truth, most mighty [[Lord]], · i̍s on e̍very side.
10. Thou rulest the ra̍ging · of the se̍a; * thou stillest the waves there·o̍f when the̍y arise.
11. Thou hast subdued Egypt, · a̍nd destro̍yed it; * thou hast scattered thine enemies abroad · wi̍th thy mi̍ghty arm.
12. The heavens are thine, the earth a̍l·so is thi̍ne; * thou hast laid the foundation of the round world, and · a̍ll that the̍rein is.
13. Thou hast made the no̍rth · and the so̍uth; * Tabor and Hermon shall re·jo̍ice in thy̍ Name.
14. Thou ha̍st a · mighty a̍rm; * strong is thy hand, and hi̍gh · is thy ri̍ght hand.
15. Righteousness and equity are the habita̍tion · of thy se̍at; * mercy and truth shall · go̍ befo̍re thy face.
16. Blessed is the people, O [[Lord]], that · ca̍n rejo̍ice in thee; * they shall walk in the li̍ght · of thy co̍untenance.
17. Their delight shall be da̍ily · in thy Na̍me; * and in thy righteousness · sha̍ll they ma̍ke their boast.
18. For thou art the glo̍ry · of their stre̍ngth, * and in thy loving-kindness thou · sha̍lt lift úp our horns.
19. For the [[Lo̍rd]] is · our defe̍nce; * the Holy One of I̍s·rael i̍s our King.
20. Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy · sa̍ints, and sa̍idst, * I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen o̍ut · of the pe̍ople.
21. I have found Da̍·vid my se̍rvant; * with my holy oil have · I̍ ano̍inted him.
22. My ha̍nd shall · hold him fa̍st, * and my · a̍rm shall stre̍ngthen him.
23. The enemy shall not be able to · do̍ him vi̍olence; * the son of wickedness · sha̍ll not húrt him.
24. I will smite down his fo̍es be·fore his fa̍ce, * and plague · the̍m that ha̍te him.
25. My truth also and my mercy · sha̍ll be wi̍th him; * and in my Name shall his ho̍rn · be exa̍lted.
26. I will set his dominion a̍lso · in the se̍a, * and his · ri̍ght hand i̍n the floods.
27. He shall call me, Tho̍u · art my Fa̍ther, * my God, and my · stro̍ng salva̍tion.
28. And I will ma̍ke · him my fi̍rst-born, * higher than the · ki̍ngs of the̍ earth.
29. My mercy will I keep for hi̍m for · evermo̍re, * and my covenant · sha̍ll stand fa̍st with him.
30. His seed also will I make to en·dúre for e̍ver, * and his throne as the · da̍ys of he̍aven.
31. But if his chi̍ldren for·sake my la̍w, * and walk not · i̍n my júdgements;
32. If they break my statutes, and keep not · my̍ comma̍ndments; * I will visit their offences with the rod, and their · si̍n with sco̍urges.
33. Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not út·terly ta̍ke from him, * nor súf·fer my trúth to fail.
34. My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone o̍ut · of my li̍ps: * I have sworn once by my holiness, that I will · no̍t fail Da̍vid.
35. His seed shall en·dúre for e̍ver, * and his seat is like as the · sún befo̍re me.
36. He shall stand fast for evermo̍re · as the mo̍on, * and as the faithful wi̍t·ness in he̍aven.
37. But thou hast abhorred and forsaken · thi̍ne Ano̍inted, * and art dis·ple̍ased a̍t him.
38. Thou hast broken the covenant · o̍f thy se̍rvant, * and cast his · cro̍wn to the̍ ground.
39. Thou hast overthrown · a̍ll his he̍dges, * and broken · do̍wn his stro̍ng holds.
40. All they that · go̍ by spo̍il him, * and he is become a repro̍ach · to his ne̍ighbours.
41. Thou hast set up the right ha̍nd · of his e̍nemies, * and made all his adver·sa̍ries to̍ rejoice.
42. Thou hast taken away the e̍dge · of his swo̍rd, * and givest him not victory · i̍n the ba̍ttle.
43. Thou hast put · o̍ut his glo̍ry, * and cast his throne · do̍wn to the̍ ground.
44. The days of his youth · ha̍st thou sho̍rtened, * and covered him · wi̍th disho̍nour.
45. [[Lord]], how long wilt thou hide thy·se̍lf? for e̍ver? * and shall · thy wräth búrn like fire?
46. O remember how · sho̍rt my ti̍me is; * wherefore hast thou · made äll me̍n for nought?
47. What man is he that liveth, and sha̍ll · not see de̍ath? * and shall he deliver his soul · fro̍m the ha̍nd of hell?
48. Lord, where are thy old · lo̍ving-ki̍ndnesses, * which thou swarest unto Da̍·vid in thy̍ truth?
49. Remember, Lord, the rebúke · that thy se̍rvants have, * and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of · ma̍ny pe̍ople.
50. Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of · thi̍ne Ano̍inted. * Praised be the [[Lord]] for evermore. A·me̍n, and A̍men.

Lord, thou hast · be̍en our re̍fuge, * from one generation · to̍ ano̍ther.
2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the · wo̍rld were ma̍de, * thou art God from everlasting, and · wo̍rld witho̍ut end.
3. Thou turnest ma̍n · to destrúction; * again thou sayest, Come again, ye · chi̍ldren o̍f men.
4. For a thousand years in thy sight are · bút as ye̍sterday, * seeing that is past as a · wa̍tch in the̍ night.
5. As soon as thou scatterest them they are e̍ven · as a sle̍ep; * and fade away súd·denly li̍ke the grass.
6. In the morning it is gre̍en, and · groweth úp; * but in the evening it is cut down, dried · úp, and wi̍thered.
7. For we consume away in · thy̍ disple̍asure, * and are afraid at thy wrathful · i̍ndigna̍tion.
8. Thou hast set our misde̍eds · before the̍e; * and our secret sins in the li̍ght · of thy co̍untenance.
9. For when thou art angry a̍ll our · days are go̍ne: * we bring our years to an end, as it were a · ta̍le that i̍s told.
10. The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong that they co̍me to · fourscore ye̍ars, * yet is their strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it a·wa̍y, and we̍ are gone.
11. But who regardeth the po̍wer · of thy wra̍th? * for even thereafter as a man feareth, so is · thy̍ disple̍asure.
12. So teach us to núm·ber our da̍ys, * that we may apply our hearts · únto wi̍sdom.
13. Turn thee again, O [[Lo̍rd]], · at the la̍st, * and be gracious un·to̍ thy se̍rvants.
14. O satisfy us with thy me̍rcy, · and that so̍on: * so shall we rejoice and be glad all the · da̍ys of o̍ur life.
15. Comfort us again now after the time that · tho̍u hast pla̍gued us; * and for the years wherein we have suffer·e̍d adve̍rsity.
16. Shew thy se̍r·vants thy wo̍rk, * and their chi̍l·dren thy glo̍ry.
17. And the glorious majesty of the [[Lord]] our God be̍ · upon ús: * prosper thou the work of our hands upon us, O prosper · tho̍u our ha̍ndywork.

\psalm{91}{Qui habitat.}
Whoso dwelleth under the defe̍nce of · the Most Hi̍gh, * shall abide under the shadow o̍f · the Almi̍ghty.
2. I will say unto the [[Lord]], Thou art my hope, · a̍nd my stro̍ng hold; * my God, in · hi̍m will I̍ trust.
3. For he shall deliver thee from the sna̍re · of the húnter, * and from the · no̍isome pe̍stilence.
4. He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe ún·der his fe̍athers; * his faithfulness and truth shall be thy · shi̍eld and búckler.
5. Thou shalt not be afraid for any te̍r·ror by ni̍ght, * nor for the arrow that · fli̍eth by̍ day;
6. For the pestilence that wa̍lk·eth in da̍rkness, * nor for the sickness that destroyeth · i̍n the no̍on-day.
7. A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand a̍t · thy right ha̍nd; * but it shall · no̍t come ni̍gh thee.
8. Yea, with thine e̍yes shalt · thou beho̍ld, * and see the reward o̍f · the ungo̍dly.
9. For thou, [[Lo̍rd]], · art my ho̍pe; * thou hast set thine house of · defënce ve̍ry high.
10. There shall no evil ha̍ppen · unto the̍e, * neither shall any plague come · ni̍gh thy dwe̍lling.
11. For he shall give his angels cha̍rge · over the̍e, * to ke̍ep · thee in a̍ll thy ways.
12. They shall be̍ar thee · in their ha̍nds, * that thou hurt not thy · fo̍ot aga̍inst a stone.
13. Thou shalt go upon the li̍·on and a̍dder: * the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread · únder thy̍ feet.
14. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will · I̍ deli̍ver him; * I will set him up, beca̍use · he hath kno̍wn my Name.
15. He shall call upon me, and · I̍ · will he̍ar him; * yea, I am with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bri̍ng · him to ho̍nour.
16. With long life will I · sa̍tisfy̍ him, * and shew him · my̍ salva̍tion.

\psalm{92}{Bonum est confiteri.}
It is a good thing to give tha̍nks un·to the [[Lo̍rd]], * and to sing praises unto thy Name, · O̍ most Hi̍ghest;
2. To tell of thy loving-kindness early · i̍n the mo̍rning, * and of thy truth in · the nïght-se̍ason;
3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, a̍nd up·on the lúte; * upon a loud instrument, · a̍nd upo̍n the harp.
4. For thou, [[Lord]], hast made me gla̍d · through thy wo̍rks; * and I will rejoice in giving praise for the opera̍·tions of thy̍ hands.
5. O [[Lord]], how glo̍rious · are thy wo̍rks! * thy · tho̍ughts are ve̍ry deep.
6. An unwise man doth not · we̍ll consi̍der this, * and a fool doth not · úndersta̍nd it.
7. When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of wicked·ne̍ss do flo̍urish, * then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou, [[Lord]], art the Most Hi̍gh·est for e̍vermore.
8. For lo, thine enemies, O [[Lord]], lo, thine ene·mi̍es shall pe̍rish; * and all the workers of wickedness shall · be̍ destro̍yed.
9. But mine horn shall be exalted like the ho̍rn · of an únicorn; * for I am ano̍int·ed with fre̍sh oil.
10. Mine eye also shall see his lúst · of mine e̍nemies, * and mine ear shall hear his desire of the wicked that arise · úp aga̍inst me.
11. The righteous shall flourish · li̍ke a pa̍lm-tree, * and shall spread abroad like a ce̍·dar in Li̍banus.
12. Such as are planted in the ho̍use · of the [[Lo̍rd]], * shall flourish in the courts of the · ho̍use of o̍ur God.
13. They also shall bring forth more frúit · in their a̍ge, * and shall be fa̍t · and well-li̍king.

2. Hide not thy face from me in the ti̍me · of my tro̍uble; * incline thine ear unto me when I call; O he̍ar · me, and tha̍t right soon.
3. For my days are consúmed a·way like smo̍ke, * and my bones are burnt up as it · we̍re a fi̍rebrand.

8. Mine enemies revile me a̍ll · the day lo̍ng; * and they that are mad upon me are sworn toge̍·ther aga̍inst me.

5. He laid the founda̍tions · of the e̍arth, * that it never should · mo̍ve at a̍ny time.
6. Thou coveredst it with the deep like as · wi̍th a ga̍rment; * the wa·ters ständ i̍n the hills.
7. At thy̍ re·buke they fle̍e; * at the voice of thy thún·der they a̍re afraid.
8. They go up as high as the hills, and down to the va̍l·leys bene̍ath; * even unto the place which thou hast ap·po̍inted fo̍r them.
9. Thou hast set them their bounds which the̍y · shall not pa̍ss, * neither turn again to · co̍ver the̍ earth.

11. All beasts of the fi̍eld · drink thereo̍f, * and the wild · a̍sses que̍nch their thirst.
12. Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their · ha̍bita̍tion, * and sing a·mo̍ng the bra̍nches.
13. He watereth the hi̍lls · from abo̍ve; * the earth is filled with the · frúit of thy̍ works.

19. He appointed the moon for · ce̍rtain se̍asons, * and the sun kno̍w·eth his go̍ing down.
20. Thou makest darkness that i̍t · may be ni̍ght; * wherein all the beasts of the · fo̍rest do̍ move.
21. The lions roaring a̍f·ter their pre̍y, * do · se̍ek their me̍at from God.
22. The sun ariseth, and they get them a·wa̍y toge̍ther, * and lay them · do̍wn in the̍ir dens.
23. Man goeth forth to his work, and · to̍ his la̍bour, * un·ti̍l the e̍vening.
24. O [[Lord]], how ma̍nifold · are thy wo̍rks! * in wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is fúll · of thy ri̍ches.

30. When thou lettest thy breath go forth the̍y · shall be ma̍de; * and thou shalt renew the · fa̍ce of the̍ earth.
31. The glorious majesty of the [[Lord]] shall en·dúre for e̍ver; * the [[Lord]] shall re·jo̍ice in hi̍s works.

7. He is the · [[Lo̍rd]] our Go̍d; * his judgements · a̍re in a̍ll the world.
8. He hath been alway mindful of his cove·na̍nt and pro̍mise, * that he made to a thousand · ge̍nera̍tions;

13. What time as they went from one nation · to̍ ano̍ther, * from one kingdom to an·o̍ther pe̍ople;
14. He suffered no ma̍n to · do them wro̍ng, * but reproved even · ki̍ngs for the̍ir sakes;
15. Touch not · mi̍ne Ano̍inted, * and do my · pro̍phets no̍ harm.
16. Moreover, he called for a de̍arth up·on the la̍nd, * and destroyed all the pro·vi̍sion o̍f bread.
17. But he had sent a · ma̍n befo̍re them, * even Joseph, who was sold to be · a bönd-se̍rvant;
18. Whose feet they húrt · in the sto̍cks; * the iron entered · i̍nto hi̍s soul;
19. Until the time ca̍me that his · cause was kno̍wn: * the word of · the [[Lörd]] tri̍ed him.
20. The king sent, and deli̍·vered hi̍m; * the prince of the people · le̍t him go̍ free.
21. He made him lord a̍lso · of his ho̍use, * and ruler of · a̍ll his súbstance;
22. That he might inform his princes a̍f·ter his wi̍ll, * and teach his se̍·nators wi̍sdom.
23. Israel also came · i̍nto E̍gypt, * and Jacob was a stranger · i̍n the la̍nd of Ham.
24. And he increased his · pe̍o·ple exce̍edingly, * and made them stronger · tha̍n their e̍nemies;
25. Whose heart turned, so that they ha̍·ted his pe̍ople, * and dealt untruly · wi̍th his se̍rvants.
26. Then sent he Mo̍·ses his se̍rvant, * and Aaron whom · he̍ had cho̍sen.
27. And these shewed his to̍·kens amo̍ng them, * and wonders · i̍n the la̍nd of Ham.
28. He sent da̍rkness, and · it was da̍rk; * and they were not obedient · únto hi̍s word.
29. He turned their wa̍ters · into blo̍od, * – · – and sle̍w their fish.
30. Their la̍nd · brought forth fro̍gs; * yea, even in · their kïngs’ cha̍mbers.
31. He spake the word, and there came all ma̍n·ner of fli̍es, * and lice in · a̍ll their qua̍rters.
32. He gave them ha̍il-·stones for ra̍in; * and flames of · fi̍re in the̍ir land.
33. He smote their vines a̍l·so and fi̍g-trees; * and destroyed the trees · tha̍t were i̍n their coasts.
34. He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars in·númera̍ble, * and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the · frúit of the̍ir ground.
35. He smote all the fi̍rst-born · in their la̍nd; * even the · chi̍ef of a̍ll their strength.
36. He brought them forth also with si̍l·ver and go̍ld; * there was not one feeble pe̍r·son amo̍ng their tribes.
37. Egypt was glad at · the̍ir depa̍rting; * for the̍y · were afra̍id of them.
38. He spread out a cloud to · be̍ a co̍vering, * and fire to give light in · the nïght-se̍ason.
39. At their desi̍re · he brought qua̍ils; * and he filled them with the · bre̍ad of he̍aven.
40. He opened the rock of stone, and the wa̍ters · flowed o̍ut, * so that rivers ran in · the drÿ pla̍ces.
41. For why? he remembered his · ho̍ly pro̍mise; * and Abra·ha̍m his se̍rvant.
42. And he brought forth his pe̍o·ple with jo̍y, * and his cho̍·sen with gla̍dness;
43. And gave them the la̍nds · of the he̍athen; * and they took the labours of the people · i̍n posse̍ssion;

O give thanks unto the Lord; for · he̍ is gra̍cious, * and his mercy endúr·eth for e̍ver.

3. Blessed are they that a̍l·way keep júdgement, * – · and dö ri̍ghteousness.
4. Remember me, O [[Lord]], according to the favour that thou bearest un·to̍ thy pe̍ople; * O visit me with · thy̍ salva̍tion;
5. That I may see the felicity · o̍f thy cho̍sen, * and rejoice in the gladness of thy people, and give thanks with · thi̍ne inhe̍ritance.
6. We have sinned · wi̍th our fa̍thers; * we have done amiss, · and dëalt wi̍ckedly.
7. Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness · i̍n reme̍mbrance; * but were disobedient at the sea, even · a̍t the Re̍d sea.
8. Nevertheless, he helped them · fo̍r his Na̍me’s sake, * that he might make his · po̍wer to̍ be known.
9. He rebuked the Red sea also, and i̍t was · dried úp; * so he led them through the deep, as · thro̍ugh a wi̍lderness.
10. And he saved them from the a̍dver·saries’ ha̍nd, * and delivered them from the ha̍nd · of the e̍nemy.
11. As for those that troubled them, the waters · o̍verwhe̍lmed them; * there was not · o̍ne of the̍m left.
12. Then beli̍eved · they his wo̍rds, * and sang · pra̍ise unto̍ him.
13. But within a while the̍y for·gat his wo̍rks, * and would not a·bi̍de his co̍unsel.
14. But lust came upon them · i̍n the wi̍lderness, * and they tempted Go̍d · in the de̍sert.
15. And he ga̍ve them · their desi̍re, * and sent leanness withal · i̍nto the̍ir soul.
16. They angered Moses a̍lso · in the te̍nts, * and Aaron the · sa̍int of the̍ [[Lord]].
17. So the earth opened, and swa̍llow·ed up Da̍than, * and covered the congregation · o̍f Abi̍ram.
18. And the fire was kindled · i̍n their co̍mpany; * the flame burnt úp · the ungo̍dly.
19. They made a · ca̍lf in Ho̍reb, * and worshipped the · mo̍lten i̍mage.
20. Thus they túrn·ed their glo̍ry * into the similitude of a · ca̍lf that e̍ateth hay.
21. And they forgat · Go̍d their Sa̍viour, * who had done so great · thi̍ngs in E̍gypt;
22. Wondrous wo̍rks in the · land of Ha̍m; * and fearful thi̍ngs · by the Re̍d sea.
23. So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood befo̍re him · in the ga̍p, * to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he · sho̍uld destro̍y them.
24. Yea, they thought sco̍rn of that · pleasant la̍nd, * and gave no credence · únto hi̍s word;
25. But múrmured · in their te̍nts, * and hearkened not unto the · vo̍ice of the̍ [[Lord]].
26. Then lift he up his · ha̍nd aga̍inst them, * to overthrow them · i̍n the wi̍lderness;
27. To cast out their seed a·mo̍ng the na̍tions, * and to sca̍t·ter them i̍n the lands.
28. They joined themselves unto · Ba̍al-pe̍or, * and ate the o̍f·ferings o̍f the dead.
29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their · o̍wn inve̍ntions; * and the plague was · gre̍at amo̍ng them.
30. Then stood up Phine·e̍s and pra̍yed; * and so · the plägue ce̍ased.
31. And that was counted unto · hi̍m for ri̍ghteousness, * among all posteri·ti̍es for e̍vermore.
32. They angered him also at the wa̍·ters of stri̍fe, * so that he punished Mo̍·ses for the̍ir sakes;
33. Because they provo̍·ked his spi̍rit, * so that he spake unadvi̍·sedly wi̍th his lips.
34. Neither destroyed · the̍y the he̍athen, * as the · [[Lo̍rd]] comma̍nded them;
35. But were mingled a·mo̍ng the he̍athen, * and · le̍arned the̍ir works.
36. Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to̍ their · own deca̍y; * yea, they offered their sons and their daughters · únto de̍vils;
37. And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and · o̍f their da̍ughters, * whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was de·fi̍led wi̍th blood.
38. Thus were they stained wi̍th · their own wo̍rks, * and went a whoring with their · o̍wn inve̍ntions.
39. Therefore was the wrath of the [[Lord]] kindled a·ga̍inst his pe̍ople, * insomuch that he abhorred his · o̍wn inhe̍ritance.
40. And he gave them over into the ha̍nds · of the he̍athen; * and they that hated them · were lörds o̍ver them.
41. Their ene·mi̍es oppre̍ssed them, * and had them · i̍n subje̍ction.
42. Many a time did · he̍ deli̍ver them; * but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down · i̍n their wi̍ckedness.
43. Nevertheless, when he saw · the̍ir adve̍rsity, * – · he hëard the̍ir complaint.
44. He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude · o̍f his me̍rcies; * yea, he made all those that led them away ca̍p·tive to pi̍ty them.
45. Deliver us, O [[Lord]] our God, and gather us from a·mo̍ng the he̍athen; * that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our · bo̍ast of thy̍ praise.

13. So when they cried unto the [[Lo̍rd]] · in their tro̍uble, * he delivered them · o̍ut of the̍ir distress.
14. For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the sha̍·dow of de̍ath, * and brake their · bo̍nds in súnder.
15. O that men would therefore praise the [[Lo̍rd]] · for his go̍odness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chi̍ldren o̍f men!

18. Their soul abhorred all ma̍n·ner of me̍at, * and they were even · ha̍rd at de̍ath’s door.
19. So when they cried unto the [[Lo̍rd]] · in their tro̍uble, * he delivered them · o̍ut of the̍ir distress.

23. They that go do̍wn to the · sea in shi̍ps, * and occupy their business · in grëat wa̍ters;
24. These men see the wo̍rks · of the [[Lo̍rd]], * and his · wo̍nders i̍n the deep.
25. For at his word the stormy · wi̍nd ari̍seth, * which lifteth · úp the wa̍ves thereof.
26. They are carried up to the heaven, and down aga̍in · to the de̍ep; * their soul melteth away beca̍use · of the tro̍uble.
27. They reel to and fro, and stagger · li̍ke a drúnken man, * and are · a̍t their wi̍t’s end.
28. So when they cry unto the [[Lo̍rd]] · in their tro̍uble, * he delivereth them · o̍ut of the̍ir distress.
29. For he ma̍keth the · storm to ce̍ase, * so that the · wa̍ves thereo̍f are still.
30. Then are they glad, because the̍y · are at re̍st; * and so he bringeth them unto the haven · whe̍re they wo̍uld be.
31. O that men would therefore praise the [[Lo̍rd]] · for his go̍odness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chi̍ldren o̍f men!
32. That they would exalt him also in the congregation · o̍f the pe̍ople, * and praise him in the se̍at · of the e̍lders!
33. Who turneth the floods in·to̍ a wi̍lderness, * and drieth · úp the wa̍ter-springs.
34. A fruitful land ma̍k·eth he ba̍rren, * for the wickedness of · the̍m that dwe̍ll therein.
35. Again, he maketh the wilderness a · sta̍nding wa̍ter, * and water-springs · o̍f a dry̍ ground.
36. And there he se̍t·teth the húngry, * that they may build them a ci̍·ty to dwe̍ll in;
37. That they may sow their la̍nd, · and plant vi̍neyards, * to yield them · frúits of i̍ncrease.
38. He blesseth them, so that they multi·ply̍ exce̍edingly; * and suffereth not their · ca̍ttle to̍ decrease.
39. And again, when they are mi̍nished · and brought lo̍w * through oppression, through any · pla̍gue or tro̍uble;
40. Though he suffer them to be evil intre̍at·ed through ty̍rants, * and let them wander out of the wa̍y · in the wi̍lderness;
41. Yet helpeth he the po̍or · out of mi̍sery, * and maketh him households · li̍ke a flo̍ck of sheep.
42. The righteous will consi̍der this, · and rejo̍ice; * and the mouth of all wickedness · sha̍ll be sto̍pped.
43. Whoso is wise will po̍n·der these thi̍ngs; * and they shall understand the loving-·ki̍ndness o̍f the [[Lord]].
