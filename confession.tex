\chapter[Confession]{\stylechapter{The Order for \\ the Reconciliation of a Penitent\\ {\small commonly called}}{Confession}{}}

\pilcrow{Note. Such as shall be satisfied with a general Confession should not be offended with them that do use, to their further satisfying, confession to the Priest; and those also which think needful or convenient, for the quietness of their own consciences, particularly to open their sins to the Priest, should not be offended with them that are satisfied with their humble confession to God, and the general Confession to the Church. But in all things everyone should follow and keep the rule of charity, and be satisfied with his own conscience, not judging other men’s minds and consciences, whereas he hath no warrant of God’s word to the same.} %1929 Scottish; slightly altered from 1549

\centerline{\pilcrow{The Penitent, kneeling, begins,}}
\centerline{Bless me, for I have sinned.}

\subsubsection{The Priest gives the blessing,}
\drop{The Lord be in thy heart and upon thy lips, that so thou mayest worthily and rightly confess all thy sins, \grealtcross\ in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.}

\medskip
\pilcrow{The Penitent then makes \emph{his} confession, saying,}

\drop{I confess to God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed, through my own grievous fault.} % Wherefore I pray God to have mercy upon me.}

And especially I have sinned in these ways . . .

% \rubric{The penitent then states the specific sins he can remember, and should end with the following:}

For these and all other sins which I cannot now remember, I am truly sorry. I pray God to have mercy on me. I firmly intend amendment of life, and I humbly beg forgiveness of God and his Church, and ask thee for penance, counsel, and absolution.
\medskip
\pilcrow{After the confession, the Priest may find it helpful to question the penitent, so that advice about possible reparation, or restitution, or how to face the future more successfully may be given.}

\pilcrow{Then some form of penance is given. This is \emph{not} a \emph{penalty} but some useful act which aids the penitent to make outward embodiment of his contrite purpose.}

%    Here the Priest may offer counsel, direction, and comfort.
\medskip
\pilcrow{The Priest then pronounces this absolution:}

\drop{Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, \grealtcross\  In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. \R Amen.}

\smallskip
The Lord hath put away all thy sins. \R Thanks be to God.

\subsubsection{The Priest concludes,}

\centerline{Go in peace, and pray for me, a sinner.}
