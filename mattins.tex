\chapter[An Introduction]{An Introduction to Morning or Evening Prayer}

\bigskip
\drop{In the name of the Father, \cross and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Amen.}
\bigskip

\pilcrow{At the beginning of Morning Prayer the Minister shall read with a loud voice some one or more of these Sentences of the Scriptures that follow.}

\drop{When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.}
\scripture{Ezekiel xviii.~27.}

I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.\scripture{Psalm lj.~3.}

Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.\scripture{Psalm lj.~9.}

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\scripture{Psalm lj.~17.}

Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.\scripture{Joel ij.~13.}

To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us.\scripture{Daniel ix.~9, 10.}

O Lord, correct me, but with judgement; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.\scripture{Jeremiah x.~24, Psalm vj.~1.}

Repent ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\scripture{St.~Matthew iij.~2.}

I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\scripture{St.~Luke xv.~18, 19.}

Enter not into judgement with thy servant, O Lord; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.\scripture{Psalm cxliij.~2.}

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\scripture{1 St.~John i.~8, 9.}

\bigskip

\pilcrow{Then the Minister shall say,}

\drop{Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge our sins before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me;}

\subsubsection{Or, except on the First Sunday in Advent and the First Sunday of in Lent, the following may be said instead,}

Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.

\smallskip

\pilcrow{A general Confession to be said of the whole Congregation after the Minister, all kneeling.}

\drop{Almighty and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, which confess their faults. Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.}

\medskip

\pilcrow{The Absolution, or Remission of sins, to be pronounced by the Priest alone, standing; the people still kneeling.}

\drop{Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness, and live; and hath given power, and commandment, to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent, the Absolution and Remission of their sins: He pardoneth \grealtcross\ and absolveth all them that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore let us beseech him to grant us true repentance, and his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him, which we do at this present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure, and holy; so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord.}
\subsubsection{The people shall answer here, and at the end of all other prayers,}
\R Amen.

\subsubsection{Or the following Absolution may be said instead,}
\drop{May the almighty and merciful Lord grant unto you pardon \grealtcross\ and remission of all your sins, time for amendment of life, and the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit. \R Amen.}

\pilcrow{If no priest be present the person saying the service shall read the Collect for the Twenty-First Sunday after Trinity, that person and the people still kneeling.}

\chapter{The Order for Mattins}
\subsubsection{Daily Throughout the Year.}

\bigskip

\pilcrow{Then the Minister shall kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer with an audible voice; the people also kneeling, and repeating it with him, both here, and wheresoever else it is used in Divine Service.}

\drop{Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen.}


\pilcrow{Here all standing up, the Priest shall say,}

\V O Lord, open thou my lips.  \R And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.

\drop{O God, \cross make speed to save me.  \R O Lord, make haste to help me.}

\V Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;  \R As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.


Alleluya.
\pilcrow{From First Evensong of Septuagesima until Easter, instead of \emph{Alleluya} is said:}

\subsection{\stylesubsec{}{Venite, exultemus Domino.}{Psalm xcv.}}
\drop{O come, let us sing unto the {\scshape Lord}; * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.}

2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.

3 For the {\scshape Lord} is a great God; * and a great King above all gods.

4 In his hand are all the corners of the earth; * and the strength of the hills is his also.

5 The sea is his, and he made it; * and his hands prepared the dry land.

6 O come, let us worship and fall down, * and kneel before the {\scshape Lord} our Maker.

7 For he is the Lord our God; * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.

8 To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;

9 When your fathers tempted me, * proved me, and saw my works.

10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways.

11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath, * that they should not enter into my rest.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.

\bigskip
\pilcrow{Then shall follow the Psalms in order as they be appointed. And at the end of every Psalm throughout the year, and likewise at the end of \emph{Benedicite, Benedictus, Magnificat,} and \emph{Nunc dimittis}, shall be repeated,}

3 As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, * which have been since the world began;

4 That we should be saved from our enemies, * and from the hand of all that hate us.

5 To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers, * and to remember his holy Covenant;

6 To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham, * that he would give us;

7 That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies * might serve him without fear;

8 In holiness and righteousness before him, * all the days of our life.

9 And thou, Child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

10 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people * for the remission of their sins,

11 Through the tender mercy of our God; * whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us;

12 To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
