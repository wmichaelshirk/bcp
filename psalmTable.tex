\section{How the Psalter is appointed to be read}

{\scriptsize
% American and Scottish are more similar to each other;
% Maybe better? Probably tend toward the scotteish for sundays
% and to the american for feasts (longer for the 6, and a couple
% extras.?
\drop{Psalms to be read at Morning and at Evening Prayer are appointed
for every Sunday in the year, and for certain other Holy-days.
Otherwise the Psalter will be read through in order once every
month as is appointed.}

Whensoever Proper Psalms are appointed, then the Psalms of
ordinary course for the day of the month shall be omitted.

On week days (unless Proper Psalms are provided) shall be read the
Psalms for the day of the month, as they are appointed, for
Morning and Evening Prayer.

And, whereas January, March, May, July, August, October, and
December have one-and-thirty days apiece; It is ordered, that on
the last day of any one of the said months being an ordinary week
day shall be read the Psalms assigned to the 30th day, or else
the Psalms of the monthly course omitted on one of the Sundays in
that month; So that the Psalter may begin again the first day of
the next month ensuing.

And, whereas the 119th Psalm is divided into twenty-two portions,
and is over-long to be read at one time; It is so ordered, that
at one time shall not be read above four or five of the said
portions.

And at the end of every Psalm, and of every such part of the
119th Psalm, shall be repeated this Hymn,


{\normalsize
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;

%\emph{Answer}. 
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.
}


Note, that the Psalter followeth the Division of the Hebrews, and
the Translation of the great English Bible, set forth and used in
the time of King \emph{Henry} the Eighth, and \emph{Edward} the Sixth.

% [Psalms have also been selected for use on various occasions,
% and on such occasions one or more at the discretion of the Minister
% may be read at Morning and Evening Prayer in place of the Psalms
% of the Day.

% Upon occasions to be approved by the Bishop, other Psalms may,
% with his consent, be substituted for the Psalms of the Day or for
% those which are appointed in the Table of Proper Psalms.]
