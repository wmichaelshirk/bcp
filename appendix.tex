3\enspace For the {\scshape Lord Jehovah} is my strength and my song;\ \star\ he also is become my salvation.

\subsection{\stylesubsec{The Song of Ezechias}{Ego dixi}{Isaiah 38.~10.}}
\drop{I said in the cutting off of my days,\ \star\ I shall go to the gates of the grave.}

2\enspace I am deprived of the residue of my years;\ \star\ I said, I shall not see the {\scshape Lord}, even the {\scshape Lord}, in the land of the living.

3\enspace I shall behold man no more\ \star\ with the inhabitants of the world.

4\enspace Mine age is departed,\ \star\ and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent.

5\enspace I have cut off like a weaver my life:\ \star\ he will cut me off with pining sickness.

6\enspace From day even to night\ \star\ wilt thou make an end of me.

7\enspace I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones:\ \star\ from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

8\enspace Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter:\ \star\ I did mourn as a dove.

9\enspace Mine eyes fail with looking upward:\ \star\ O {\scshape Lord}, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

10\enspace What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it:\ \star\ I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

11\enspace O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit:\ \star\ so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.

12\enspace Behold, for peace I had great bitterness; but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:\ \star\ for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

13\enspace For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:\ \star\ they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

14\enspace The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:\ \star\ the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

15\enspace The {\scshape Lord} was ready to save me:\ \star\ therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the {\scshape Lord}.

\subsection{\stylesubsec{The Song of Hannah}{Exultavit cor meum}{1 Samuel 2.~1.}}
\drop{My heart rejoiceth in the {\scshape Lord},\ \star\ mine horn is exalted in the {\scshape Lord}.}

2\enspace My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;\ \star\ because I rejoice in thy salvation.

3\enspace There is none holy as the {\scshape Lord}:\ \star\ for there is none beside thee; neither is there any rock like our God.

4\enspace Talk no more so exceeding proudly;\ \star\ let not arrogancy come out of your mouth.

5\enspace For the {\scshape Lord} is a God of knowledge,\ \star\ and by him actions are weighed.

6\enspace The bows of the mighty men are broken,\ \star\ and they that stumbled are girded with strength.

7\enspace They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;\ \star\ and they that were hungry ceased.

8\enspace So that the barren hath born seven;\ \star\ and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

9\enspace The {\scshape Lord} killeth, and maketh alive:\ \star\ he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

10\enspace The {\scshape Lord} maketh poor, and maketh rich:\ \star\ he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

11\enspace He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,\ \star\ and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill.

12\enspace To set them among princes,\ \star\ and to make them inherit the throne of glory.

13\enspace For the pillars of the earth are the {\scshape Lord}’s,\ \star\ and he hath set the world upon them.

14\enspace He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness;\ \star\ for by strength shall no man prevail.

15\enspace The adversaries of the {\scshape Lord} shall be broken to pieces;\ \star\ out of heaven shall he thunder upon them.

16\enspace The {\scshape Lord} shall judge the ends of the earth;\ \star\ and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

\rubric{Ant.} The Lord shall judge \ \star\ the ends of the earth.

\subsection{\stylesubsec{The Song of Moses}{Cantemus Domino}{Exodus 15.~1.}}

\drop{I will sing unto the {\scshape Lord}, for he hath triumphed gloriously:\ \star\ the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.}

2\enspace The {\scshape Lord} is my strength and song,\ \star\ and he is become my salvation.

3\enspace He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;\ \star\ my father’s God, and I will exalt him.

4\enspace The {\scshape Lord} is a man of war:\ \star\ the {\scshape Lord} is his name.

5\enspace Pharao’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:\ \star\ his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

6\enspace The depths have covered them:\ \star\ they sank into the bottom as a stone.

7\enspace Thy right hand, O {\scshape Lord}, is become glorious in power:\ \star\ thy right hand, O {\scshape Lord}, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

8\enspace And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee:\ \star\ thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.

9\enspace And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,\ \star\ the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

10\enspace The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;\ \star\ my lust shall be satisfied upon them.

11\enspace I will draw my sword,\ \star\ my hand shall destroy them.

12\enspace Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:\ \star\ they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

13\enspace Who is like unto thee, O {\scshape Lord}, among the gods?\ \star\ who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

14\enspace Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,\ \star\ the earth swallowed them.

15\enspace Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed:\ \star\ thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

16\enspace The people shall hear, and be afraid:\ \star\ sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

17\enspace Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed;\ \star\ the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

18\enspace Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone;\ \star\ till thy people pass over, O {\scshape Lord}, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

19\enspace Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,\ \star\ in the place, O {\scshape Lord}, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

20\enspace The {\scshape Lord} shall reign\ \star\ for ever and ever.

21\enspace For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea,\ \star\ and the {\scshape Lord} brought again the waters of the sea upon them.

\subsection{\stylesubsec{The Song of Abacuc}{Domine, audivi}{Habakkuk 3.~2.}}
\drop{O LORD, I have heard thy speech,\ \star\ and was afraid.}

2\enspace O {\scshape Lord}, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known;\ \star\ in wrath remember mercy.

3\enspace God came from Teman,\ \star\ and the Holy One from mount Paran.

4\enspace His glory covered the heavens,\ \star\ and the earth was full of his praise.

5\enspace And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand:\ \star\ and there was the hiding of his power.

6\enspace Before him went the pestilence,\ \star\ and burning coals went forth at his feet.

7\enspace He stood, and measured the earth, he beheld, and drove asunder the nations;\ \star\ and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow; his ways are everlasting.

8\enspace I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:\ \star\ and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.

9\enspace Was the {\scshape Lord} displeased against the rivers?\ \star\ was thine anger against the rivers?

10\enspace Was thy wrath against the sea,\ \star\ that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

11\enspace Thy bow was made quite naked,\ \star\ according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word.

12\enspace Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers; \ \star\ The mountains saw thee, and they trembled.

13\enspace The overflowing of the water passed by:\ \star\ the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.

14\enspace The sun and moon stood still in their habitation:\ \star\ at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.

15\enspace Thou didst march through the land in indignation,\ \star\ thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.

16\enspace Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,\ \star\ even for salvation with thine anointed.

17\enspace Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,\ \star\ by discovering the foundation unto the neck.

18\enspace Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:\ \star\ they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me; their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

19\enspace  Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,\ \star\ through the heap of great waters.

20\enspace When I heard, my belly trembled;\ \star\ my lips quivered at the voice.

21\enspace Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself,\ \star\ that I might rest in the day of trouble.

22\enspace When he cometh up unto the people,\ \star\ he will invade them with his troops.

23\enspace Although the fig-tree shall not blossom,\ \star\ neither shall fruit be in the vines;

24\enspace The labour of the olive shall fail,\ \star\ and the fields shall yield no meat;

25\enspace The flock shall be cut off from the fold,\ \star\ and there shall be no herd in the stalls;

26\enspace Yet I will rejoice in the {\scshape Lord},\ \star\ I will joy in the God of my salvation.

27\enspace The {\scshape Lord} God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet,\ \star\ and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.

\rubric{Ant.} O Lord,\ \star\ I have heard thy speech, and was afraid.

\subsection{\stylesubsec{The Song of Moses}{Audite, celi}{Deut. 32.~1.}}

\drop{Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;\ \star\ and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.}

2\enspace My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew,\ \star\ as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass.

3\enspace Because I will publish the Name of the {\scshape Lord}:\ \star\ ascribe ye greatness unto our God.

4\enspace He is the Rock, his work is perfect:\ \star\ for all his ways are judgment.

5\enspace A God of truth and without iniquity,\ \star\ just and right is he.

6\enspace They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children:\ \star\ they are a perverse and crooked generation.

7\enspace Do ye thus requite the {\scshape Lord}, O foolish people and unwise?\ \star\ is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?

8\enspace Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations:\ \star\ ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.

9\enspace When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance,\ \star\ when he separated the sons of Adam,

10\enspace He set the bounds of the people\ \star\ according to the number of the children of Israel.

11\enspace For the {\scshape Lord}’s portion is his people;\ \star\ Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

12\enspace He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness;\ \star\ he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

13\enspace As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:\ \star\ so the {\scshape Lord} alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.

14\enspace He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields;\ \star\ and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.

15\enspace Butter of kine, and milk of sheep,\ \star\ with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan,

16\enspace And goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat;\ \star\ and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

17\enspace But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:\ \star\ thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness;

18\enspace Then he forsook God which made him,\ \star\ and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

19\enspace They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods,\ \star\ with abominations provoked they him to anger.

20\enspace They sacrificed unto devils, not to God;\ \star\ to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

21\enspace Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,\ \star\ and hast forgotten God that formed thee.

22\enspace And when the {\scshape Lord} saw it, he abhorred them,\ \star\ because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

23\enspace And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be:\ \star\ for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.

24\enspace They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;\ \star\ they have provoked me to anger with their vanities;

25\enspace And I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people;\ \star\ I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

26\enspace For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell,\ \star\ and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

27\enspace I will heap mischiefs upon them;\ \star\ I will spend mine arrows upon them.

28\enspace They shall be burnt with hunger,\ \star\ and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction.

29\enspace I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them,\ \star\ with the poison of serpents of the dust.

30\enspace The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,\ \star\ the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

31\enspace I said, I would scatter them into corners,\ \star\ I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men.

32\enspace Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,\ \star\ lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely:

33\enspace And lest they should say, Our hand is high,\ \star\ and the {\scshape Lord} hath not done all this.

34\enspace For they are a nation void of counsel,\ \star\ neither is there any understanding in them.

35\enspace O that they were wise, that they understood this,\ \star\ that they would consider their latter end!

36\enspace How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,\ \star\ except their Rock had sold them, and the {\scshape Lord} had shut them up?

37\enspace For their rock is not as our Rock,\ \star\ even our enemies themselves being judges.

38\enspace For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,\ \star\ and of the fields of Gomorrah.

39\enspace Their grapes are grapes of gall,\ \star\ their clusters are bitter.

40\enspace Their wine is the poison of dragons,\ \star\ and the cruel venom of asps.

41\enspace Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?\ \star\ To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence.

42\enspace Their foot shall slide in due time; for the day of their calamity is at hand,\ \star\ and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

43\enspace For the {\scshape Lord} shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants,\ \star\ when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.

44\enspace And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,\ \star\ which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.

45\enspace See now that I, even I, am he,\ \star\ and there is no god with me.

46\enspace I kill, and I make alive; I wound and I heal:\ \star\ neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.

47\enspace For I lift up my hand to heaven,\ \star\ and say, I live for ever.

48\enspace If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment;\ \star\ I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.

49\enspace I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,\ \star\ and my sword shall devour flesh.

50\enspace And that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,\ \star\ from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

51\enspace Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people:\ \star\ for he will avenge the blood of his servants;

52\enspace And will render vengeance to his adversaries,\ \star\ and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

\rubric{Ant.} And for his servants \star\ shall the Lord repent himself.

\drop{Beloved in Christ, be it this Christmas Eve our care and delight to prepare ourselves to hear again the message of the Angels, and in heart and mind to go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass, and the Babe lying in a manger.}

Therefore let us read and mark in Holy Scripture the tale of the loving purposes of God from the first days of our disobedience unto the glorious Redemption brought us by this Holy Child.

But first, let us pray for the needs of the whole world; for peace on earth and goodwill among all his people; for unity and brotherhood within the Church he came to build, and especially in this city (town, village) of ... and church of ...

And because this of all things would rejoice his heart, let us remember, in his name, the poor and helpless, the cold, the hungry, and the oppressed; the sick and them that mourn, the lonely and the unloved, the aged and the little children; all those who know not the Lord Jesus, or who love him not, or who by sin have grieved his heart of love.

Lastly, let us remember before God all those who rejoice with us, but upon another shore, and in a greater light, that multitude which no man can number, whose hope was in the Word made flesh, and with whom in the Lord Jesus we are for ever one.

These prayers and praises let us humbly offer up to the Throne of Heaven, in the words which Christ himself hath taught us:

\drop{Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.

And let our mother the church rejoice, brightened by the radiance of so great a light: and let these courts resound with the mighty voices of the people.}

Wherefore I pray and beseech you, beloved brethren, attending the glorious brightness of this illumination, that ye call with one accord upon the loving kindness of our God, merciful and mighty.  That he who hath deigned graciously to number me, the most unworthy of his servants among the order of deacons[Levites], would pour upon me the light of his Holy Spirit, that I may worthily perform this sacred Paschal office.

\V The Lord be with you.  \R And with thy spirit.

\V Lift up your hearts.  \R We lift them up unto the Lord.

\V Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.  \R It is meet and right so to do.


\drop{It is very meet and right, to proclaim with desire of heart and mind, the invisible God omnipotent, the Father, and his only begotten Son with the Holy Spirit.  For he did pay for us the debt of Adam to the eternal Father, and blotted out the old sin in his holy blood.}

For this is the Paschal Feast in which that very Lamb is slain, and by his blood the door-posts are hallowed.  This is the night in which thou madest our fathers, the children of Israel, whom thou broughtest up out of Egypt, to pass through the Red Sea dry-shod.  This therefore is the night wherein were driven away the shades of sin by the light of the pillar.

O thrice blessed night, in which Egypt is utterly destroyed and the Hebrews triumph, night in which heavenly things are joined unto earthly. [moved to after the lighting in both roman and sarum]

This is the night which even now restores grace and unites the believers in Christ thoughtout the universe, set free from the evil of the world and the darkness of sin. This is the night, in which Christ burst the bonds of death, and from the grave is risen again in triumph.  For it had advantaged us nothing to be born, except we had been redeemed.

O wondrous condescension of thy love concerning us. O inestimable love of thy fatherly compassion: to redeem rebel servants thou didst give thine only Son! [O truly needful sin of Adam and of ourselves, which was blotted out by the Death of Christ!  O happy guilt, the desert of which was to gain such and so great a Redeemer!] O truly blessed night which alone was witness of the hour and season wherein Christ perfected his Resurrection!

This is the night whereof it is written ‘The night is as clear as the day’, and, ‘My night is turned to day in my joy and gladness’.  Therefore through the sanctifying power of this night wickedness fleeth, sin is purged, and innocense restored to the fallen, and joy to the sorrowful; hatred vanisheth, peaceful concord reigneth, low laid is tyranny.


{\centering\rubric{Here the Deacon places five grains of incense in the candle in the form of a Cross.}\par}


Therefore in honour of this night, receive, holy Father, this illumination[incense]  as our evening sacrifice, which to thee in this solemn oblation of wax, the work of bees, the Holy Church offereth at the hands of her ministers. Full well we know the tidings of this fiery pillar, which in honour of our God the glowing flame is kindling.


{\centering\rubric{Here the paschal candle shall be lighted from the triple candle and thereupon all the other tapers and lamps throughout the church shall be kindled.}\par}


Though it be dispersed in many quarters by borrowed radiance, yet it suffereth no diminution; nourished it is by melting wax brought forth for sustenance to this precious shining luminary by the labour of the bee.

O thrice blessed night, in which Egypt is utterly destroyed and the Hebrews triumph, night in which heavenly things are joined unto earthly.

We pray thee, O Lord, that this candle, consecrated to the honour of thy Name, may last unfailing for the dispersing of the darkness of this night.  Being acceptable for its sweet odour, let it be joined with the lights above. Let the morning star find it burning, to wit that morning star which knoweth no setting; Yea he who returned from the grave, and shone serene upon mankind.

We therefore pray thee, O Lord, that unto us thy servants, all the clergy and most devout people, together with our Archbishop, \emph{N.} [and our King \emph{N.}] and likewise our Bishop \emph{N.}, thou wilt grant quietness of times, and that in these Paschal joys thou wilt be pleased to preserve us:  Who ever livest, reignest, governest, and also art praised, God, alone, only the most high, Jesu Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. \R Amen.

\subsubsection{Acknowledgment of God’s Mercy and Preservation, especially through the Night past.}
\drop{Almighty and everlasting God, in whom we live and move and have our being; We, thy needy creatures, render thee our humble praises, for thy preservation of us from the beginning of our lives to this day, and especially for having delivered us from the dangers of the past night. For these thy mercies, we bless and magnify thy glorious Name; humbly beseeching thee to accept this our morning sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; for his sake who lay down in the grave, and rose again for us, thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}


\subsubsection{Dedication of Soul and Body to God’s Service, with a Resolution to be growing daily in Goodness.}
\drop{And since it is of thy mercy, O gracious Father, that another day is added to our lives; We here dedicate both our souls and our bodies to thee and thy service, in a sober, righteous, and godly life: in which resolution, do thou, O merciful God, confirm and strengthen us; that, as we grow in age, we may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}


\subsubsection{Prayer for Grace to enable us to perform that Resolution.}
\drop{But, O God, who knowest the weakness and corruption of our nature, and the manifold temptations which we daily meet with; We humbly beseech thee to have compassion on our infirmities, and to give us the constant assistance of thy Holy Spirit; that we may be effectually restrained from sin, and incited to our duty. Imprint upon our hearts such a dread of thy judgments, and such a grateful sense of thy goodness to us, as may make us both afraid and ashamed to offend thee. And, above all, keep in our minds a lively remembrance of that great day, in which we must give a strict account of our thoughts, words, and actions to him whom thou hast appointed the Judge of quick and dead, thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.}

\wflettrine{M}{ost} merciful God, who art of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and hast promised forgiveness to all those who confess and forsake their sins; We come before thee in an humble sense of our own unworthiness, acknowledging our manifold transgressions of thy righteous laws.* But, O gracious Father, who desirest not the death of a sinner, look upon us, we beseech thee, in mercy, and forgive us all our transgressions. Make us deeply sensible of the great evil of them; and work in us an hearty contrition; that we may obtain forgiveness at thy hands, who art ever ready to receive humble and penitent sinners; for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ, our only Saviour and Redeemer. Amen.


\subsubsection{Prayer for Grace to reform and grow Better.}
\drop{And lest, through our own frailty, or the temptations which encompass us, we be drawn again into sin, vouchsafe us, we beseech thee, the direction and assistance of thy Holy Spirit. Reform whatever is amiss in the temper and disposition of our souls; that no unclean thoughts, unlawful designs, or inordinate desires, may rest there. Purge our hearts from envy, hatred, and malice; that we may never suffer the sun to go down upon our wrath; but may always go to our rest in peace, charity, and good-will, with a conscience void of offence towards thee, and towards men; that so we may be preserved pure and blameless, unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}


\subsubsection{The Intercession.}

Be gracious unto thy Church; and grant that every member of the same, in his vocation and ministry, may serve thee faithfully. Bless all in authority over us; and so rule their hearts and strengthen their hands, that they may punish wickedness and vice, and maintain thy true religion and virtue. Send down thy blessings, temporal and spiritual, upon all our relations, friends, and neighbours. Reward all who have done us good, and pardon all those who have done or wish us evil, and give them repentance and better minds. Be merciful to all who are in any trouble; and do thou, the God of pity, administer to them according to their several necessities; for his sake who went about doing good, thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}

\drop{To our prayers, O Lord, we join our unfeigned thanks for all thy mercies; for our being, our reason, and all other endowments and faculties of soul and body; for our health, friends, food, and raiment, and all the other comforts and conveniences of life. Above all, we adore thy mercy in sending thy only Son into the world, to redeem us from sin and eternal death, and in giving us the knowledge and sense of our duty towards thee. We bless thee for thy pa-tience with us, notwithstanding our many and great provo-cations; for all the directions, assistances, and comforts of thy Holy Spirit; for thy continual care and watchful providence over us through the whole course of our lives; and particularly for the mercies and benefits of the past day; beseeching thee to continue these thy blessings to us, and to give us grace to show our thankfulness in a sincere obedience to his laws, through whose merits and intercession we received them all, thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}

\drop{Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,
And lighten with celestial fire.}
Thou the anointing Spirit art, 
Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.

\medskip
Thy blessed unction from above, 
Is comfort, life, and fire of love.
Enable with perpetual light 
The dulness of our blinded sight.


\medskip
Anoint and cheer our soiled face 
With the abundance of thy grace. 
Keep far our foes, give peace at home; 
Where thou art guide, no ill can come.


\medskip
Teach us to know the Father, Son, 
And thee, of both, to be but One; 
That, through the ages all along, 
This may be our endless song:


\medskip
    Praise to thy eternal merit, 
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

\drop{O gracious Light,
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,}
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!

\medskip
Now as we come to the setting of the sun,
and our eyes behold the vesper light,
we sing thy praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

\medskip
Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,
O Son of God, O Giver of life,
and to be glorified through all the worlds.
