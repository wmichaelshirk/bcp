1. The Order has no constitution except its members.

As it was said: \emph{Others he saved, himself he cannot save.}

2. It recommends nevertheless that its members shall make a formal act of union with it and of recognition of their own nature.

As it was said: \emph{Am I my brothers keeper?}

3. Its concern is the practice of the apprehension of the Co-inherence both as a natural and a supernatural principle.

As it was said: \emph{Let us make man in our image.}

4. It is therefore, per necessitatem, Christian.

As it was said: \emph{And who ever says that there was when this was not, let him be anathema.}

5.. It recommends therefor the study, on the contemplative side, of the Co-inherence of the Holy and Blessed Trinity, of the Two natures in the single person, of the Mother and Son, of the communicated Eucharist, and of the whole catholic Church.

As it was said: \emph{figlia et tuo figlio.}

And on the the active side, of methods of exchange, in the Sate, in all forms of love, and in all natural things, such as child-birth.

As it was said: \emph{Bear ye one another's burdens.}

6. It concludes in the Divine Substitution of Messias* all forms of exchange and substitution, and it invokes this Act as the root of all.

As it was said: \emph{He must become, as it were, a double man.}

7. The Order will associate itself primarily with four feasts: the Feast of the Annunciation, the Feast of the Blessed Trinity, the Feast of the Transfiguration, and the Commemoration of All Souls.

As it was said: \emph{Another will be in me and I in him.}
