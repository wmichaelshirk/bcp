For these thy mercies, we bless and magnify thy glorious Name; humbly beseeching thee to accept this our morning sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; for his sake who lay down in the grave, and rose again for us, thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}


\subsubsection{Dedication of Soul and Body to God’s Service, with a Resolution to be growing daily in Goodness.}

Amen.}


\subsubsection{Prayer for Grace to enable us to perform that Resolution.}

Imprint upon our hearts such a dread of thy judgments, and such a grateful sense of thy goodness to us, as may make us both afraid and ashamed to offend thee.

Knit together in constant affection those who, in holy wedlock, have been made one flesh; turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers; and so enkindle fervent charity among us all, that we be evermore kindly affectioned with brotherly love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.}


\subsubsection{For all Poor, Homeless, and Neglected Folk.}
\drop{O God, Almighty and merciful, who healest those that are broken in heart, and turnest the sadness of the sorrowful to joy; Let thy fatherly goodness be upon all that thou hast made. Remember in pity such as are this day destitute, homeless, or forgotten of their fellow-men. Bless the congregation of thy poor. Uplift those who are cast down. Mightily befriend innocent sufferers, and sanctify to them the endurance of their wrongs. Cheer with hope all discouraged and unhappy people, and by thy heavenly grace preserve from falling those whose penury tempteth them to sin; though they be troubled on every side, suffer them not to be distressed; though they be perplexed, save them from despair. Grant this, O Lord, for the love of him, who for our sakes became poor, thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}


\subsubsection{For Faithfulness in the Use of this World’s Goods.}
\drop{Almight God, whose loving hand hath given us all that we possess; Grant us grace that we may honour thee with our substance, and remembering the account which we must one day give, may be faithful stewards of thy bounty; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.}


\subsubsection{A General Intercession.}
\drop{O God, at whose word man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening; Be merciful to all whose duties are difficult or burdensome, and comfort them concerning their toil. Shield from bodily accident and harm the workmen at their work. Protect the efforts of sober and honest industry, and suffer not the hire of the labourers to be kept back by fraud. Incline the heart of employers and of those whom they employ to mutual forbearance, fairness, and good-will. Give the spirit of governance and of a sound mind to all in places of authority. Bless all those who labour in works of mercy or in schools of good learning. Care for all aged persons, and all little children, the sick and the afflicted, and those who travel by land or by sea. Remember all who by reason of weakness are overtasked, or because of poverty are forgotten. Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; and according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die. Give ear unto our prayer, O merciful and gracious Father, for the love of thy dear Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.}

\drop{Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,
And lighten with celestial fire.}
Thou the anointing Spirit art, 
Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.

\medskip
Thy blessed unction from above, 
Is comfort, life, and fire of love.
Enable with perpetual light 
The dulness of our blinded sight.


\medskip
Anoint and cheer our soiled face 
With the abundance of thy grace. 
Keep far our foes, give peace at home; 
Where thou art guide, no ill can come.


\medskip
Teach us to know the Father, Son, 
And thee, of both, to be but One; 
That, through the ages all along, 
This may be our endless song:


\medskip
    Praise to thy eternal merit, 
    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,}
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!

Now as we come to the setting of the sun,
and our eyes behold the vesper light,
we sing thy praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

\medskip
Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,
O Son of God, O Giver of life,
and to be glorified through all the worlds.
