\psalm{1}{Beatus vir, qui non abiit, \&c.}
Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the · wáy of sínners, * and hath not sat in the séat · of the scórnful.
2. But his delight is in the láw · of the [[Lórd]]; * and in his law will he exercise · himsëlf dáy and night.
3. And he shall be like a tree planted bý · the wáter-side, * that will bring forth his frúit · in due séason.
4. His leaf also · sháll not wíther; * and look, whatsoever he doeth, · ít shall prósper.
5. As for the ungodly, it is nót · so with thém; * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the · fáce of thé earth.
6. Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand · ín the júdgement, * neither the sinners in the congregation · óf the ríghteous.
7. But the [[Lord]] knoweth the wáy · of the ríghteous; * and the way of the ungód·ly shall pérish.

\psalm{2}{Quare fremuerunt gentes?}
Why do the heathen so furiously · ráge togéther? * and why do the people imá·gine a váin thing?
2. The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take cóun·sel togéther * against the [[Lord]], and against · hís Anóinted.
3. Let us break their · bónds asúnder, * and cast a·wáy their córds from us.
4. He that dwelleth in heaven shall láugh · them to scórn: * the Lord shall have them · ín derísion.
5. Then shall he speak unto thém · in his wráth, * and vex them in his · sóre displéasure.
6. Yet háve I · set my Kíng * upon my holy · híll of Sýon.
7. I will preach the law, whereof the [[Lord]] hath sáid · unto mé, * Thou art my Son, this day have · Í begótten thee.
8. Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for · thíne inhéritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for · thý posséssion.
9. Thou shalt bruise them with a · ród of íron, * and break them in pieces like a · pótter’s véssel.
10. Be wise now thérefore, · O ye kíngs; * be learned, ye that are · júdges óf the earth.
11. Sérve the · [[Lord]] in féar, * and rejoice unto · hím with réverence.
12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish fróm · the right wáy, * if his wrath be kindled, yea, but a little. Blessed are all they that · pút their trúst in him.

\psalm{3}{Domine, quid multiplicati?}
Lord, how are they incréas·ed that tróuble me! * many are they that · ríse agáinst me.
2. Many one there be that sáy · of my sóul, * There is no help for · hím in hís God.
3. But thou, O [[Lord]], art · mý defénder; * thou art my worship, and the lifter · úp of mý head.
4. I did call upon the [[Lórd]] · with my vóice, * and he heard me óut · of his hóly hill.
5. I laid me down and slept, and róse · up agáin; * for the · [[Lórd]] sustáined me.
6. I will not be afraid for ten thousands · óf the péople, * that have set themselves a·gáinst me róund about.
7. Up, [[Lord]], and hélp me, · O my Gód, * for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of · thé ungódly.
8. Salvation belongeth ún·to the [[Lórd]]; * and thy blessing is up·ón thy péople.

\psalm{4}{Cum invocarem.}
Hear me when I call, O Gód · of my ríghteousness: * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken · únto mý prayer.
2. O ye sons of men, how long will ye blas·phéme mine hónour, * and have such pleasure in vanity, and séek · after léasing?
3. Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the mán · that is gódly; * when I call upon the Lord, · hé will héar me.
4. Stand in áwe, · and sin nót; * commune with your own heart, and in your · chámber, ánd be still.
5. Offer the sacri·fíce of ríghteousness, * and put your · trúst in thé [[Lord]].
6. There be má·ny that sáy, * Who will · shéw us ány good?
7. [[Lord]], · líft thou úp * the light of thy counte·nánce upón us.
8. Thou hast put gládness · in my héart; * since the time that their corn and wine and · óil incréased.
9. I will lay me down in péace, and · take my rést; * for it is thou, [[Lord]], only, that makest me · dwéll in sáfety.

\psalm{5}{Verba mea auribus.}
Ponder my · wórds, O Lórd, * consider my · méditátion
2. O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my Kíng, · and my Gód: * for unto thée · wíll I máke my prayer.
3. My voice shalt thou hear be·tímes, O [[Lórd]]; * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, · ánd will lóok up.
4. For thou art the God that hast no pléa·sure in wíckedness; * neither shall any · évil dwéll with thee.
5. Such as be foolish shall not stánd · in thy síght; * for thou hatest all thém · that work vánity.
6. Thou shalt destroy thém · that speak léasing: * the [[Lord]] will abhor both the blood-thirsty · ánd decéitful man.
7. But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude · óf thy mércy; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy · hóly témple.
8. Lead me, O [[Lord]], in thy righteousness, becáuse · of mine énemies; * make thy way · pláin befóre my face.
9. For there is no fáithfulness · in his móuth; * their inward parts are · véry wíckedness.
10. Their throat is an · ópen sépulchre; * they · flátter wíth their tongue.
11. Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own i·máginátions; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebél·led agáinst thee.
12. And let all them that put their trúst in · thee rejóice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be · jóyful ín thee;
13. For thou, [[Lord]], wilt give thy blessing un·tó the ríghteous, * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defénd · him as wíth a shield.

\psalterday{1}{Evening}
\psalm{6}{Domine, ne in furore.}
O Lord, rebuke me not in thine · índignátion, * neither chasten me in · thý displéasure. 
2. Have mercy upon me, O [[Lórd]], for · I am wéak; * O [[Lord]], heal me, for my · bónes are véxed.
3. My soul also · is sóre tróubled: * but, [[Lord]], how long · wílt thou púnish me?
4. Turn thee, O [[Lord]], and delí·ver my sóul; * O save me · fór thy mércy’s sake.
5. For in death no man remém·bereth thée; * and who will give · thee thänks ín the pit?
6. I am weary of my groaning; every night wásh · I my béd, * and water my · cóuch with mý tears.
7. My beauty is gone for · véry tróuble, * and worn away because of · áll mine énemies.
8. Away from me, all yé · that work vánity; * for the [[Lord]] hath heard the vóice · of my wéeping.
9. The [[Lord]] hath heard · mý petítion; * the [[Lórd]] · will recéive my prayer.
10. All mine enemies shall be confounded, · and sóre véxed; * they shall be turned back, and put · to shäme súddenly.

\psalm{7}{Domine, Deus meus.}
O Lord my God, in thee háve I · put my trúst: * save me from all them that persecute me, · ánd delíver me;
2. Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and téar · it in píeces, * while · thére is nóne to help.
3. O [[Lord]] my God, if I have done á·ny such thíng; * or if there be any wíck·edness ín my hands;
4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt fríend·ly with mé; * yea, I have delivered him that without any cause · ís mine énemy,
5. Then let mine enemy persecute my · sóul, and táke me; * yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine · hónour ín the dust.
6. Stand up, O [[Lord]], in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation · óf mine énemies; * arise up for me in the judgement that thou · hást commánded.
7. And so shall the congregation of the people cóme · about thée: * for their sakes therefore lift · úp thysélf again.
8. The [[Lord]] shall judge the people: give sentence wíth · me, O [[Lórd]], * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency · thát is ín me.
9. O let the wickedness of the ungodly cóme · to an énd; * – · but güide thóu the just.
10. For the · ríghteous Gód * trieth the · véry héarts and reins.
11. My help cóm·eth of Gód, * who preserveth thém · that are trúe of heart.
12. God is a righteous Judge, · stróng, and pátient; * and God is pro·vóked évery day.
13. If a man will not turn, hé will · whet his swórd; * he hath bent his bow, and · máde it réady.
14. He hath prepared for him the ínstru·ments of déath; * he ordaineth his arrows against the · pérsecútors.
15. Behold, he travail·éth with míschief; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought · fórth ungódliness.
16. He hath graven and dígged · up a pít, * and is fallen on himself into the destruction that he · máde for óther.
17. For his travail shall come upón · his own héad, * and his wickedness shall fáll · on his ówn pate.
18. I will give thanks unto the [[Lord]], according · tó his ríghteousness; * and I will praise the Náme · of the [[Lórd]] Most High.

\psalm{8}{Domine, Dominus noster.} 
O Lord our Governor, how excellent is thy Náme in · all the wórld; * thou that hast set thy glory a·bóve the héavens! 
2. Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, becáuse · of thine énemies, * that thou mightest still the enemy ánd · the avénger.
3. For I will consider thy heavens, even the wórks · of thy fíngers; * the moon and the stars, which thou · hást ordáined.
4. What is man, that thou art mínd·ful of hím? * and the son of man, that thou · vísitést him?
5. Thou madest him lower · thán the ángels, * to crown him with gló·ry and wórship.
6. Thou makest him to have dominion of the wórks · of thy hánds; * and thou hast put all things in subjection · únder hís feet;
7. All · shéep and óxen; * yea, and the · béasts of thé field;
8. The fowls of the air, and the físhes · of the séa; * and whatsoever walketh through the · páths of thé seas.
9. O · [[Lórd]] our Góvernor, * how excellent is thy · Náme in áll the world!




\psalterday{2}{Morning}
\psalm{9}{Confitebor tibi.}
I will give thanks unto thee, O [[Lord]], wíth · my whole héart; * I will speak of all thy · márvellóus works.
2. I will be glád and re·joice in thée; * yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O · thóu Most Híghest.
3. While mine enemíes are · driven báck, * they shall fall and perish · át thy présence.
4. For thou hast maintained my ríght · and my cáuse; * thou art set in the · thróne that júdgest right.
5. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed · thé ungódly; * thou hast put out their name for év·er and éver.
6. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpé·tual énd; * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, their memorial is pé·rished wíth them.
7. But the [[Lord]] shall en·dúre for éver; * he hath also prepared his · séat for júdgement.
8. For he shall judge the · wórld in ríghteousness, * and minister true judgement un·tó the péople.
9. The [[Lord]] also will be a defence fór · the oppréssed, * even a refuge in due · tíme of tróuble.
10. And they that know thy Name will pút their · trust in thée; * for thou, [[Lord]], hast never failed · thém that séek thee.
11. O praise the [[Lord]] which dwéll·eth in Sýon; * shew the people · óf his dóings.
12. For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he re\-mém·\-bereth thém, * and forgetteth not the com·pláint of thé poor.
13. Have mercy upon me, O [[Lord]]; consider the trouble which I suffer of · thém that háte me, * thou that liftest me up · fróm the gátes of death.
14. That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the dáugh·ter of Sýon: * I will rejoice in · thý salvátion.
15. The heathen are sunk down in the pít · that they máde; * in the same net which they hid privily, is · their föot táken.
16. The [[Lord]] is known to éx·ecute júdgement; * the ungodly is trapped in the wórk · of his ówn hands.
17. The wicked shall be túrned · into héll, * and all the people · thát forgét God.
18. For the poor shall not alway · bé forgótten; * the patient abiding of the meek shall not pé·rish for éver.
19. Up, [[Lord]], and let not man háve the · upper hánd; * let the heathen be júdg·ed in thý sight.
20. Put thém in · fear, O [[Lórd]], * that the heathen may know them·sélves to bé but men.

\psalm{10}{Ut quid, Domine?}
Why standest thou so far · óff, O [[Lórd]], * and hidest thy face in the needful · tíme of tróuble?
2. The ungodly for his own lust doth pérse·cute the póor: * let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they · háve imágined.
3. For the ungodly hath made boast of his own · héart’s desíre, * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom · [[Gód]] abhórreth.
4. The ungodly is so proud, that he cáreth · not for Gód, * neither is · Gód in áll his thoughts.
5. His ways are · álway gríevous; * thy judgements are far above out of his sight, and therefore defieth he · áll his énemies.
6. For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall néver · be cast dówn, * there shall no harm háp·pen untó me.
7. His mouth is full of cursing, de·céit, and fráud; * under his tongue is ungodli·néss and vánity.
8. He sitteth lurking in the thievish córners · of the stréets, * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are · sét agáinst the poor.
9. For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh hé · in his dén, * that he may · rávish thé poor.
10. He doth rá·vish the póor, * when he getteth him · ínto hís net.
11. He falleth down, and húm·bleth himsélf, * that the congregation of the poor may fall into the hánds · of his cáptains.
12. He hath said in his heart, Tush, God · háth forgótten; * he hideth away his face, and he will · néver sée it.
13. Arise, O [[Lord]] God, and líft · up thine hánd; * – · forgët nót the poor.
14. Wherefore should the wícked · blaspheme Gód, * while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God cár·est not fór it?
15. Surely · thóu hast séen it; * for thou beholdest ungód·liness ánd wrong,
16. That thou mayest take the matter ín·to thy hánd; * the poor committeth himself unto thee; for thou art the helper · óf the fríendless.
17. Break thou the power of the ungodly · ánd malícious; * take away his ungodliness, and · thóu shalt fínd none.
18. The [[Lord]] is King for év·er and éver, * and the heathen are perished · óut of thé land.
19. [[Lord]], thou hast heard the desíre · of the póor; * thou preparest their heart, and thine ear héark·eneth théreto;
20. To help the fatherless and poor ún·to their ríght, * that the man of the earth be no more exál·ted agáinst them.

\psalm{11}{In Domino confido.}
In the [[Lord]] pút · I my trúst; * how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a · bírd untó the hill?
2. For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows with·ín the quíver, * that they may privily shoot at thém · which are trúe of heart.
3. For the foundations wíll · be cast dówn, * and whát · hath the ríghteous done?
4. The [[Lord]] is in his · hóly témple; * the [[Lord]]’s séat · is in héaven.
5. His eyes consí·der the póor, * and his eyelids try the · chíldren óf men.
6. The [[Lord]] allów·eth the ríghteous: * but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness, · dóth his sóul abhor.
7. Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, · stórm and témpest: * this shall be their · pórtion tó drink.
8. For the righteous [[Lord]] · lóveth ríghteousness; * his countenance will behold the · thíng that ís just.


\psalterday{2}{Evening}
\psalm{12}{Salvum me fac.}
Help me, [[Lord]], for there is not one gód·ly man léft; * for the faithful are minished from among the · chíldren óf men.
2. They talk of vanity every one · wíth his néighbour; * they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble · ín their dóuble heart.
3. The [[Lord]] shall root out áll de·ceitful líps, * and the tongue that · spéaketh próud things;
4. Which have said, With our tóngue will · we preváil; * we are they that ought to speak; who · is lörd óver us?
5. Now for the comfortless trouble’s sáke · of the néedy, * and because of the deep · síghing óf the poor,
6. I will úp, · saith the [[Lórd]]; * and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will · sét him át rest.
7. The words of the · [[Lórd]] are púre words; * even as the silver, which from the earth is tried, and purified sé·ven times ín the fire.
8. Thou shalt kéep · them, O [[Lórd]]; * thou shalt preserve him from this generá·tion for éver.
9. The ungodly walk on év·ery síde: * when they are exalted, the children of men are · pút to rébuke.

\psalm{13}{Usque quo, Domine?}
How long wilt thou forget me, O · Lórd; for éver? * how long wilt thou · híde thy fáce from me?
2. How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so véxed · in my héart? * how long shall mine enemies · tríumph óver me?
3. Consider, and héar me, O · [[Lord]] my Gód; * lighten mine eyes, that I · sléep not ín death.
4. Lest mine enemy say, I have preváil·ed agáinst him: * for if I be cast down, they that trouble me · wíll rejóice at it.
5. But my trust is · ín thy mércy, * and my heart is joyful in · thý salvátion.
6. I will sing of the [[Lord]], because he hath dealt so lóving·ly with mé; * yea, I will praise the Name of the · Lórd Most Híghest.

\psalm{14}{Dixit insipiens.} 
The fool hath sáid · in his héart, * – · Thére is nó God.
2. They are corrupt, and become abominable · ín their dóings; * there is none that do·eth göod, nó not one.
3. The [[Lord]] looked down from heaven upon the chíl·dren of mén, * to see if there were any that would understand, · and sëek áfter God.
4. But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become a·bómináble; * there is none that do·eth göod, nó not one.
5. Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have · théy decéived; * the poison of asps is · únder théir lips.
6. Their mouth is full of cúrs·ing and bítterness; * their feet are · swíft to shéd blood.
7. Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace háve · they not knówn; * there is no fear of · Gód befóre their eyes.
8. Have they no knowledge, that they are all such wórk·ers of míschief, * eating up my people as it were bread, and call · nót upón the [[Lord]]?
9. There were they brought in great fear, even whére · no fear wás; * for God is in the generation · óf the ríghteous.
10. As for you, ye have made a mock at the cóunsel · of the póor; * because he putteth his · trúst in thé [[Lord]].
11. Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Syon? When the [[Lord]] turneth the captivity · óf his péople, * then shall Iacob rejoice, and Ís·rael sháll be glad.


\psalterday{3}{Morning}
\psalm{15}{Domine, quis habitabit?} 
Lord, who shall dwell in thy · tábernácle? * or who shall rest up·ón thy hóly hill?
2. Even he that leadeth an ún·corrupt lífe, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the · trúth from hís heart.
3. He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil · tó his néighbour, * and hath not slander·éd his néighbour.
4. He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly ín · his own éyes, * and maketh much of · thém that féar the [[Lord]].
5. He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappóin·teth him nót, * though it were to · his öwn híndrance.
6. He that hath not given his money · úpon úsury, * nor taken reward a·gáinst the ínnocent.
7. Whoso dó·eth these thíngs * – · – shall néver fall.

\psalm{16}{Conserva me, Domine.} 
Presérve · me, O Gód; * for in thee · háve I pút my trust.
2. O my soul, thou hast sáid un·to the [[Lórd]], * Thou art my God; my goods are · nóthing únto thee.
3. All my delight is upon the saints, thát are · in the éarth, * and upon such as ex·cél in vírtue.
4. But they that run áfter an·other gód * shall · háve great tróuble.
5. Their drink-offerings of blood will · Í not óffer, * neither make mention of their · námes withín my lips.
6. The [[Lord]] himself is the portion of mine inheritance, ánd · of my cúp; * thou · shált maintáin my lot.
7. The lot is fallen unto me ín · a fair gróund; * yea, I have a · góodly héritage.
8. I will thank the [[Lord]] for gív·ing me wárning; * my reins also chasten me in · the nïght-séason.
9. I have set [[God]] ál·ways befóre me; * for he is on my right hand, therefore · Í shall nót fall.
10. Wherefore my heart was glad, and my gló·ry rejóiced: * my flesh ál·so shall rést in hope.
11. For why? thou shalt not léave my · soul in héll; * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to · sée corrúption.
12. Thou shalt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is the fúl·ness of jóy, * and at thy right hand there is pléa·sure for évermore.

\psalm{17}{Exaudi, Domine.} 
Hear the right, O [[Lord]], consíder · my compláint, * and hearken unto my prayer, that goeth not · óut of féigned lips.
2. Let my sentence come forth · fróm thy présence; * and let thine eyes look upon the thíng · that is équal.
3. Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wícked·ness in mé; * for I am utterly purposed that my · móuth shall nót offend.
4. Because of men’s works, that are done against the wórds · of thy líps: * I have kept me from the ways óf · the destróyer.
5. O hold thou up my góings · in thy páths, * that my · fóotsteps slíp not.
6. I have called upon thee, O God, for · thóu shalt héar me: * incline thine ear to me, and hearken · únto mý words.
7. Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which pút their · trust in thée, * from such as re·síst thy ríght hand.
8. Keep me as the ápple · of an éye; * hide me under the shá·dow of thý wings.
9. From the ungód·ly that tróuble me; * mine enemies compass me round about to · táke awáy my soul.
10. They are inclosed ín · their own fát, * and their mouth · spéaketh próud things.
11. They lie waiting in our way on é·very síde, * turning their eyes · dówn to thé ground.
12. Like as a lion that is gréedy · of his préy, * and as it were a lion’s whelp, lurking in · sécret pláces.
13. Up, [[Lord,]] disappoint him, and · cást him dówn; * deliver my soul from the ungodly, which · ís a swórd of thine;
14. From the men of thy hand, O [[Lord]]; from the men, I say, and fróm the · evil wórld; * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with · thý hid tréasure.
15. They have chíldren at · their desíre, * and leave the rest of their súb·stance for théir babes.
16. But as for me, I will behold thy pré·sence in ríghteousness; * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satis·fíed wíth it.


\psalterday{3}{Evening}
\psalm{18}{Diligam te, Domine.} 
I will love thee, O [[Lord]], my strength. The [[Lord]] is my stony róck, and · my defénce; * my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, · ánd my réfuge.
2. I will call upon the [[Lord]], which is worthy · tó be práised; * so shall I be safe · fróm mine énemies.
3. The sorrows of death cóm·passed mé, * and the overflowings of ungodli·ness máde mé afraid.
4. The pains of hell cáme · about mé; * the snares of death · óvertóok me.
5. In my trouble I will cáll up·on the [[Lórd]], * and complain · únto mý God:
6. So shall he hear my voice out of his · hóly témple, * and my complaint shall come before him; it shall enter even · ínto hís ears.

7. The earth trém·bled and quáked, * the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed, · becáuse hé was wroth.
8. There went a smoke out · ín his présence, * and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were · kíndled át it.
9. He bowed the heavens álso, · and came dówn, * and it was dark · únder hís feet.
10. He rode upon the Cherubins, · ánd did flý; * he came flying upon · the wíngs óf the wind.
11. He made dárkness his · secret pláce, * his pavilion round about him, with dark water and thick · clóuds to cóver him.
12. At the brightness of his presence his · clóuds remóved; * hail·stónes, and cóals of fire.
13. The [[Lord]] also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest · gáve his thúnder; * hail·stónes, and cóals of fire.
14. He sent out his arrows, and scát·tered thém; * he cast forth lightnings, · ánd destróyed them.
15. The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were discovered, at thy chí·ding, O [[Lórd]], * at the blasting of the breath of · thý displéasure.

3. The [[Lord]] comfort him, when he lieth síck up·on his béd; * make thou all his béd · in his síckness.
4. I said, [[Lord]], be mérciful · unto mé; * heal my soul, for I have sín·ned agáinst thee.
5. Mine enemies speak é·vil of mé, * When shall he die, and · his näme pérish?
6. And if he come to see me, he · spéaketh vánity, * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself, and when he cometh · fórth he télleth it.
7. All mine enemies whisper to·géther agáinst me; * even against me do they imá·gine this évil.

Like as the hart desír·eth the wáter-brooks, * so longeth my soul · áfter thée, O God.
2. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even · fór the líving God: * when shall I come to appear before the · présence óf God?
3. My tears have been my méat · day and níght, * while they daily say unto me, · Whére is nów thy God?
4. Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my héart · by mysélf; * for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth in·tó the hóuse of God;

9. One deep calleth another, because of the nóise · of the wáter-pipes; * all thy waves and stórms · are gone óver me.
10. The [[Lord]] hath granted his loving-kindness · ín the dáy-time; * and in the night-season did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the · Gód of mý life.
11. I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast · thóu forgótten me? * why go I thus heavily, while the ene·mý opprésseth me?
12. My bones are smitten asúnder as · with a swórd, * while mine enemies that trouble me · cást me ín the teeth;

14. Why art thou so véxed, · O my sóul? * and why art thou so disquiet·éd withín me?
15. O pút thy · trust in Gód; * for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my cóun·tenance, ánd my God.

We have heard with our ears, O God, our fá·thers have tóld us * what thou hast dóne · in their tíme of old:
2. How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and plánt·ed them ín; * how thou hast destroyed the ná·tions, and cást them out.
3. For they gat not the land in possession thróugh · their own swórd, * neither was it their own · árm that hélped them;
4. But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the líght · of thy cóuntenance; * because thou hadst a · fávour únto them.
5. Thou árt my · King, O Gód; * send hélp · unto Jácob.
6. Through thee will we over·thrów our énemies, * and in thy Name will we tread them under, that rise · úp agáinst us.
7. For I will not trúst · in my bów, * it is not my swórd · that shall hélp me;
8. But it is thou that savest us · fróm our énemies, * and puttest them to confú·sion that háte us.
9. We make our boast of Gód · all day lóng, * and will praise thy · Náme for éver.
10. But now thou art far off, and puttest us · tó confúsion, * and goest not fórth · with our ármies.
11. Thou makest us to turn our backs up·ón our énemies, * so that they which · háte us spóil our goods.
12. Thou lettest us be éaten · up like shéep, * and hast scattered us a·móng the héathen.
13. Thou sellest thy péo·ple for nóught, * and takest no · móney fór them.
14. Thou makest us to be rebuked · óf our néighbours, * to be laughed to scorn, and had in derision of them that are · róund abóut us.
15. Thou makest us to be a by-word a·móng the héathen, * and that the people · sháke their héads at us.
16. My confusion is dái·ly befóre me, * and the shame of my face hath · cóveréd me;
17. For the voice of the slanderer ánd blasphémer, * for the enemy · ánd avénger.
18. And though all this be come upon us, yet do we · nót forgét thee, * nor behave ourselves frowardly · ín thy cóvenant.
19. Our heart ís not · turned báck, * neither our steps gone · óut of thý way;
20. No, not when thou hast smitten us into the · pláce of drágons, * and covered us with the · shádow óf death.
21. If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to · ány stránge god, * shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very · sécrets óf the heart.
22. For thy sake also are we killed all · the day lóng, * and are counted as sheep ap·póinted tó be slain.
23. Up, · Lórd, why sléepest thou? * awake, and be not absent from · ús for éver.
24. Wherefore hídest · thou thy fáce, * and forgettest our mise·rý and tróuble?
25. For our soul is brought low, even ún·to the dúst; * our belly cleav·eth úntó the ground.
26. A·ríse, and hélp us, * and deliver us · fór thy mércy’s sake.


\psalm{45}{Eructavit cor meum.}
My heart is inditing óf · a good mátter; * I speak of the things which I have · máde untó the King.

3. Thou art fairer than the chíl·dren of mén; * full of grace are thy lips, because God hath blessed · thée for éver.
4. Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O · thóu Most Míghty, * according to thy · wórship ánd renown.
5. Good luck have thou · wíth thine hónour: * ride on, because of the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee · térriblé things.
6. Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be sub·dúed únto thee, * even in the midst among · the Kïng’s énemies.
7. Thy seat, O God, endúr·eth for éver; * the sceptre of thy kingdom is · a rïght scéptre.
8. Thou hast loved righteousness, and há·ted iníquity; * wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness a·bóve thy féllows.
9. All thy garments smell of myrrh, á·loes, and cássia; * out of the ivory palaces, whereby · théy have máde thee glad.
10. Kings’ daughters were among thy honour·áble wómen; * upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with · dívers cólours.
11. Hearken, O daughter, and consider; inc·líne thine éar; * forget also thine own people, · ánd thy fáther’s house.
12. So shall the King have pleasure · ín thy béauty; * for he is thy Lord God, and · wórship thóu him.

3. My mouth shall · spéak of wísdom, * and my heart shall muse of · únderstánding.

6. There be some that put their trúst · in their góods, * and boast themselves in the multitude · óf their ríches.
7. But no man may delí·ver his bróther, * nor make agreement · únto Gód for him;
8. For it cost móre to re·deem their sóuls, * so that he must let that a·lóne for éver;

10. For he seeth that wise men also die, and pér·ish togéther, * as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their rích·es for óther.
11. And yet they think that their houses shall contín·ue for éver, * and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the lands áf·ter their ówn names.
12. Nevertheless, man will not a·bíde in hónour, * seeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish; thís · is the wáy of them.

14. They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall have domination over them · ín the mórning: * their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre óut · of their dwélling.

4. Against thee only have I sinned, and done this évil · in thy síght; * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when · thóu art júdged.
5. Behold, I was shá·pen in wíckedness, * and in sin hath my mó·ther concéived me.

7. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and Í · shall be cléan; * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be · whíter thán snow.

4. Thou hast loved unrighteousness · móre than góodness, * and to talk of líes · more than ríghteousness.
5. Thou hast loved to speak all wórds that · may do húrt, * – · Ó thou fálse tongue.
6. Therefore shall God destróy · thee for éver; * he shall take thee, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the lánd · of the líving.

28. Let them fall from one wickedness · tó anóther, * and not come ín·to thy ríghteousness.
29. Let them be wiped out of the bóok · of the líving, * and not be written a·móng the ríghteous.
30. As for me, when I am póor · and in héaviness, * thy help, O · Gód, shall líft me up.
31. I will praise the Name of Gód · with a sóng, * and magnify it · wíth thanksgíving.
32. This álso shall · please the [[Lórd]] * better than a bullock · thát hath hórns and hoofs.
33. The humble shall consider thís, · and be glád: * seek ye after God, · ánd your sóul shall live.
34. For the [[Lord]] héar·eth the póor, * and despiseth · nót his prísoners.
35. Let heaven · and éarth práise him: * the sea, and all that · móveth thérein.
36. For God will save Syon, and build the cí·ties of Iúdah, * that men may dwell there, and have it · ín posséssion.
37. The posterity also of his servants · sháll inhérit it; * and they that love his · Náme shall dwéll therein.

\psalm{70}{Deus in adjutorium.}
Haste thee, O Gód, · to delíver me; * make haste to · hélp me, Ó [[Lord]].
2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek áf·ter my sóul; * let them be turned backward and put to confusion that · wísh me évil.
3. Let them for their reward be sóon · brought to sháme, * that cry ó·ver me, Thére! there!
4. But let all those that seek thee be jóy·ful and glád in thee: * and let all such as delight in thy salvation say alway, The · Lórd be práised.
5. As for me, I am póor · and in mísery: * haste thee · únto mé, O God.

In thee, O [[Lord]], have I put my trust; let me never be pút · to confúsion, * but rid me and deliver me in thy righteousness; incline thine ear unto · mé, and sáve me.

3. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand óf · the ungódly, * out of the hand of the unrígh·teous and crúel man.

\psalm{73}{Quam bonus Israel!}
Truly God is loving · únto Ísrael: * even unto such as are · óf a cléan heart.
2. Nevertheless, my féet were · almost góne, * my tréad·ings had wéll-nigh slipt.
3. And why? I was grieved · át the wícked: * I do also see the ungodly in · súch prospérity.
4. For they are in no pé·ril of déath; * but are · lústy ánd strong.
5. They come in no misfórtune like · other fólk; * neither are they plá·gued like óther men.
6. And this is the cause that they are so hóld·en with príde, * and overwhélm·ed with crúelty.
7. Their eyes · swéll with fátness, * and they do · éven whát they lust.
8. They corrupt other, and speak of · wícked blásphemy; * their talking is a·gáinst the Móst High.
9. For they stretch forth their mouth un·tó the héaven, * and their tongue · góeth thróugh the world.
10. Therefore fall the · péople únto them, * and thereout suck they no · smáll advántage.
11. Tush, say they, how should · Gód percéive it? * is there knowledge · ín the Móst High?
12. Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches · ín posséssion: * and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed mine hands in · ínnocéncy.
13. All the day long have · Í been púnished, * and chastened · évery mórning.
14. Yea, and I had almost said é·ven as théy; * but lo, then I should have condemned the generation · óf thy chíldren.
15. Then thought I to · únderstánd this; * but ít · was too hárd for me,
16. Until I went into the sanctuá·ry of Gód: * then understood I the · énd of thése men;
17. Namely, how thou dost set them in slíp·pery pláces, * and castest them dówn, · and destróyest them.
18. O how suddenly dó · they consúme, * perish, and cóme · to a féarful end!
19. Yea, even like as a dream when · óne awáketh; * so shalt thou make their image to vanish óut · of the cíty.
20. Thus my · héart was gríeved, * and it went · éven thróugh my reins.
21. So foolish was · Í, and ígnorant, * even as it were a · béast befóre thee.
22. Nevertheless, I am ál·way by thée; * for thou hast holden me · bý my ríght hand.
23. Thou shalt guide me · wíth thy cóunsel, * and after that recéive · me with glóry.
24. Whom have I in héa·ven but thée? * and there is none upon earth that I desire in compá·rison óf thee.
25. My flesh and · my héart fáileth; * but God is the strength of my heart, and my pór·tion for éver.
26. For lo, they that forsake · thée shall pérish; * thou hast destroyed all them that commit fornicá·tion agáinst thee.
27. But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trúst in · the Lord [[Gód]], * and to speak of all thy works in the gates of the dáugh·ter of Sýon.

\psalm{74}{Ut quid, Deus?}
O God, wherefore art thou absent fróm · us so lóng? * why is thy wrath so hot against the shéep · of thy pásture?
2. O think upon thy · cóngregátion, * whom thou hast purchased and re·déemed óf old.
3. Think upon the tribe of · thíne inhéritance, * and mount Syon, where·ín thou hást dwelt.
4. Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy év·ery énemy, * which hath done evil in thy · sánctuáry.
5. Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy · cóngregátions, * and set up their bán·ners for tókens.
6. He that hewed timber afore óut of · the thick trées, * was known to bring it to an · éxcellént work.
7. But now they break down all the cárved · work thereóf * with áx·es and hámmers.
8. They have set fire upon thy · hóly pláces, * and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name, even · únto thé ground.
9. Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havock of them · áltogéther: * thus have they burnt up all the houses · of Göd ín the land.
10. We see not our tokens; there is nót one · prophet móre; * no, not one is there among us, that under·stándeth ány more.
11. O God, how long shall the adversary do · thís dishónour? * how long shall the enemy blaspheme thy · Náme, for éver?
12. Why withdráwest · thou thy hánd? * why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to con·súme the énemy?
13. For Gód is my · King of óld; * the help that is done upon earth, he · dóeth ít himself.
14. Thou didst divide the sea · thróugh thy pówer; * thou brakest the heads of the dragons · ín the wáters.
15. Thou smotest the heads of Levia·thán in píeces, * and gavest him to be meat for the people · ín the wílderness.
16. Thou broughtest out fountains and waters óut of · the hard rócks; * thou driedst up · míghty wáters.
17. The day is thíne, and the · night is thíne; * thou hast prepared the · líght and thé sun.
18. Thou hast set all the bórders · of the éarth; * thou hast made súm·mer and wínter.
19. Remember this, O [[Lord]], how the enemy · háth rebúked; * and how the foolish people hath blasphémed thý Name.
20. O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude · óf the énemies; * and forget not the congregation of the · póor for éver.
21. Look up·ón the Cóvenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel · hábitátions.
22. O let not the simple go a·wáy ashámed; * but let the poor and needy give praise · únto thý Name.
23. Arise, O God, maintáin · thine own cáuse; * remember how the foolish man blasphém·eth thee dáily.
24. Forget not the vóice · of thine énemies: * the presumption of them that hate thee increaseth · éver móre and more.

Unto thee, O Gód, do · we give thánks; * yea, unto thee · dó we gíve thanks.
2. Thy Name álso · is so nígh; * and that do thy · wóndrous wórks declare.

4. The earth is weak, and all the inhábi·ters thereóf: * I bear up the píl·lars óf it.
5. I said unto the fools, Deal · nót so mádly; * and to the ungodly, · Sét not úp your horn.
6. Set not úp your · horn on hígh, * and speak not · wíth a stíff neck.
7. For promotion cometh neither from the éast, nor · from the wést, * nor · yét from thé south.
8. And why? Gód · is the Júdge; * he putteth down one, and setteth · úp anóther.
9. For in the hand of the [[Lord]] there is a cúp, and the · wine is réd; * it is full mixed, and he poureth · óut of thé same.
10. Ás for the · dregs thereóf, * all the ungodly of the earth shall drínk · them, and súck them out.
11. But I will talk of the · Gód of Jácob, * and práise · him for éver.

In Jéwry · is God knówn; * his Name is · gréat in Ísrael.
2. At Salem is his · tábernácle, * and his dwél·ling in Sýon.
3. There brake he the árrows · of the bów, * the shield, the swórd, · and the báttle.
4. Thou art of more hó·nour and míght, * than the hílls · of the róbbers.
5. The proud are robbed, théy have · slept their sléep; * and all the men whose hands were mighty · have föund nóthing.
6. At thy rebuke, O · Gód of Jácob, * both the chariot and · hórse are fállen.
7. Thou, even thou art · tó be féared; * and who may stand in thy sight when · thóu art ángry?
8. Thou didst cause thy judgement to be · héard from héaven; * the earth · trémbled, ánd was still,
9. When God a·róse to júdgement, * and to help all the · méek upón earth.
10. The fierceness of man shall túrn · to thy práise; * and the fierceness of · thém shalt thóu refrain.
11. Promise unto the [[Lord]] your God, and keep it, all ye that are · róund abóut him; * bring presents unto him that óught · to be féared.
12. He shall refrain the spí·rit of prínces, * and is wonderful among the · kíngs of thé earth.

\psalm{77}{Voce mea ad Dominum.}
I will cry unto Gód · with my vóice; * even unto God will I cry with my voice, and he shall · héarken únto me.
2. In the time of my tróuble I · sought the Lórd: * my sore ran and ceased not in the night-season; my soul re·fúsed cómfort.
3. When I am in heaviness, I will thínk · upon Gód; * when my heart is véx·ed, I wíll complain.
4. Thou holdest · míne eyes wáking: * I am so feeble, · thát I cánnot speak.
5. I have consideréd the · days of óld, * and the · yéars that áre past.
6. I call to remém·brance my sóng, * and in the night I commune with mine own heart, and search · óut my spírits.
7. Will the Lord absent him·sélf for éver? * and will he be no · móre intréated?
8. Is his mercy clean · góne for éver? * and is his promise come utterly to an · énd for évermore?
9. Hath God forgotten · tó be grácious? * and will he shut up his loving-kindness · ín displéasure?
10. And I said, It is mine · ówn infírmity; * but I will remember the years of the right hand of · the Möst Híghest.
11. I will remember the wórks · of the [[Lórd]], * and call to mind thy wón·ders of óld time.
12. I will think álso of · all thy wórks, * and my talking shall bé · of thy dóings.
13. Thy way, O · Gód, is hóly: * who is so great a · Gód as óur God?
14. Thou art the God that · dóeth wónders, * and hast declared thy power a·móng the péople.
15. Thou hast mightily deliver·éd thy péople, * even the sons of Já·cob and Jóseph.
16. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters sáw thee, and · were afráid; * the depths ál·so were tróubled.
17. The clouds poured out water, · the áir thúndered, * and thine · árrows wént abroad.
18. The voice of thy thunder was héard · round abóut: * the lightnings shone upon the ground; the earth was móv·ed, and shóok withal.

\psalterday{15}{Evening}
\psalm{78}{Attendite, popule.}
Hear my law, · Ó my péople, * incline your ears unto the · wórds of mý mouth.
2. I will open my móuth · in a párable; * I will declare hard · séntencés of old;
3. Which wé have · heard and knówn; * and such as our fá·thers have tóld us;
4. That we should not hide them from the children of the generá·tions to cóme; * but to shew the honour of the [[Lord]], his mighty and wonderful · wórks that hé hath done.
5. He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Ísra·el a láw, * which he commanded our forefathers to · téach their chíldren;
6. That their postéri·ty might knów it, * and the children · whích were yét unborn;
7. To the intent that whén · they came úp, * they might shew their · chíldren thé same;
8. That they might pút their · trust in Gód * and not to forget the works of God, but to kéep · his commándments;
9. And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn · génerátion; * a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not sted·fástly únto God;
10. Like as the chíl·dren of Éphraym; * who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in the · dáy of báttle.
11. They kept not the cóve·nant of Gód, * and would not · wálk in hís law;
12. But forgát what · he had dóne, * and the wonderful works that he had · shéwed fór them.
13. Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the · lánd of Égypt, * even in the · fíeld of Zóan.
14. He divided the sea, and lét · them go thróugh; * he made the waters to · stánd on án heap.
15. In the day-time also he léd them · with a clóud, * and all the night thróugh · with a líght of fire.
16. He clave the hard rócks · in the wílderness, * and gave them drink thereof, as it had been óut · of the gréat depth.
17. He brought waters óut of the · stony róck, * so that it gushed out · líke the rívers.
18. Yet for all this they sinned · móre agáinst him, * and provoked the most Highest · ín the wílderness.
19. They tempted Gód · in their héarts, * and required · méat for théir lust.
20. They spake against God · álso, sáying, * Shall God prepare a table · ín the wílderness?
21. He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams flów·ed withál; * but can he give bread also, or provide flésh · for his péople?
22. When the [[Lord]] héard this, · he was wróth; * so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy displeasure · agäinst Ísrael;
23. Because they belíeved · not in Gód, * and put not their · trúst in hís help.
24. So he commánded the · clouds abóve, * and opened the · dóors of héaven.
25. He rained down manna also upón them · for to éat, * and gave them · fóod from héaven.
26. So mán did eat · angels’ fóod; * for he · sént them méat enough.
27. He caused the east-wind to blow · únder héaven; * and through his power he bróught · in the sóuthwest-wind.
28. He rained flesh upón them as · thick as dúst, * and feathered fowls like as the · sánd of thé sea.
29. He let it fáll a·mong their ténts, * even round about their · hábitátion.
30. So they did eat and were well filled, for he gáve them their · own desíre: * they were not disappóint·ed of théir lust.
31. But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the wéalthi·est of thém; * yea, and smote down the chosen men that · wére in Ísrael.
32. But for all this they sín·ned yet móre, * and believed · nót his wóndrous works.
33. Therefore their days did he con·súme in vánity, * and their · yéars in tróuble.
34. When he sléw · them, they sóught him, * and turned them early, and in·quíred áfter God.
35. And they remembered that Gód · was their stréngth, * and that the high God was · théir redéemer.
36. Nevertheless, they did but flátter him · with their móuth, * and dissembled · wíth him ín their tongue.
37. For their heart · wás not whóle with him, * neither continued they stedfast · ín his cóvenant.
38. But he was so merciful, that he forgáve · their misdéeds, * and de·stróyed thém not.
39. Yea, many a time turned hé his · wrath awáy, * and would not suffer his whole dis·pléasure tó arise.
40. For he considered that théy · were but flésh, * and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and · cómeth nót again.
41. Many a time did they provoke him · ín the wílderness, * and grieved him · ín the désert.
42. They turned báck, and · tempted Gód, * and moved the Holy · Óne in Ísrael.
43. They thóught not · of his hánd, * and of the day when he delivered them from the hánd · of the énemy;
44. How he had wrought his mira·clés in Égypt, * and his wonders in the · fíeld of Zóan.
45. He turned their wáters · into blóod, * so that they might not drínk · of the rívers.
46. He sent lice among them, and devóur·ed them úp; * and frógs · to destróy them.
47. He gave their fruit unto the · cáterpíllar, * and their labour unto · the grässhópper.
48. He destroyed their · vínes with háil-stones, * and their mulberry-·trées with thé frost.
49. He smote their cattle ál·so with háil-stones, * and their flócks · with hot thúnderbolts.
50. He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, dis·pléasure and tróuble: * and sent evil án·gels amóng them.
51. He made a way to his indignation, and spared nót their · soul from déath; * but gave their life over · tó the péstilence;
52. And smote all the fírst-·born in Égypt, * the most principal and mightiest in the · dwéllings óf Ham.
53. But as for his own people, he léd them · forth like shéep, * and carried them in the wíl·derness líke a flock.
54. He brought them out safely, thát they · should not féar, * and overwhelmed their én·emies wíth the sea.
55. And brought them within the borders of his · sánctuáry, * even to his mountain which he purchased · wíth his ríght hand.
56. He cast out the heathen ál·so befóre them, * caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to · dwéll in théir tents.
57. So they tempted and displéased the · Most High Gód, * and kept not his · téstimónies;
58. But turned their backs, and fell away like · théir forefáthers; * starting aside · líke a bróken bow.
59. For they grieved him with · théir hill-áltars, * and provoked him to displeasure · wíth their ímages.
60. When God héard this, · he was wróth, * and took sore displéa·sure at Ísrael.
61. So that he forsook the taberná·cle in Sýlo, * even the tent that he had pítch·ed amóng men.
62. He delivered their power ín·to captívity, * and their beauty into the · énemíes’ hand.
63. He gave his people over also ún·to the swórd, * and was wroth with · hís inhéritance.
64. The fire consú·med their yóung men, * and their maidens were not gív·en to márriage.
65. Their priests were sláin · with the swórd, * and there were no widows to make · lámentátion.
66. So the Lord awaked as óne · out of sléep, * and like a giant re·fréshed wíth wine.
67. He smote his enemies ín the · hinder párts, * and put them to a per·pétuál shame.
68. He refused the taberná·cle of Jóseph, * and chose not the · tríbe of Éphraym;
69. But chose the · tríbe of Iúdah, * even the hill of Syon · whích he lóved.
70. And there he built his tém·ple on hígh, * and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath · máde contínually.
71. He chose David ál·so his sérvant, * and took him awáy · from the shéep-folds.

\psalm{79}{Deus, venerunt.}
O God, the heathen are come into · thíne inhéritance; * thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusa·lém an héap of stones.
2. The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fówls · of the áir, * and the flesh of thy saints unto the · béasts of thé land.
3. Their blood have they shed like water on every síde · of Jerúsalem, * and there was nó · man to búry them.
4. We are become an open sháme · to our énemies, * a very scorn and derision unto them that are · róund abóut us.
5. [[Lord]], how long wilt · thóu be ángry? * shall thy jealousy burn like · fíre for éver?
6. Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that · háve not knówn thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have not cál·led upón thy Name.
7. For they have de·vóured Jácob, * and laid · wáste his dwélling-place.
8. O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upón us, · and that sóon; * for we are cóme · to great mísery.
9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glóry · of thy Náme: * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, · fór thy Náme’s sake.
10. Wherefore dó the · heathen sáy, * – · Whére is nów their God?
11. O let the vengeance of thy servants’ blóod · that is shéd, * be openly shewed upon the héa·then in óur sight.
12. O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners · cóme befóre thee; * according to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are ap·póinted tó die.
13. And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours háve blas·phemed thée, * reward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold in·tó their bósom.
14. So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee · thánks for éver, * and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to · génerátion.

8. Thou hast brought a vine · óut of Égypt; * thou hast cast out the héa·then, and plánted it.

10. The hills were covered with the shá·dow of ít, * and the boughs thereof were like the · góodly cédar-trees.
11. She stretched out her branches ún·to the séa, * and her boughs un·tó the ríver.
12. Why hast thou then bróken · down her hédge, * that all they that go · bý pluck óff her grapes?
13. The wild boar out of the wóod doth · root it úp, * and the wild beasts of the · fíeld devóur it.
14. Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look · dówn from héaven, * behold, and · vísit thís vine;

3. Blow up the trumpet ín · the new-móon, * even in the time appointed, and upon our · sólemn féast-day.
4. For this was made a stá·tute for Ísrael, * and a law of the · Gód of Jácob.
5. This he ordained in Joseph for a · téstimóny, * when he came out of the land of Egypt, and had heard · a stränge lánguage.
6. I eased his shoulder · fróm the búrden, * and his hands were delivered from · máking thé pots.
7. Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delív·ered thée; * and heard thee what time as the storm · féll upón thee.

9. Hear, O my people; and I will assúre · thee, O Ísrael, * if thou wilt · héarken únto me,
10. There shall no strange gód · be in thée, * neither shalt thou worship · ány óther god.
11. I am the [[Lord]] thy God, who brought thee out of the · lánd of Égypt: * open thy mouth wide, and · Í shall fíll it.
12. But my people wóuld not · hear my vóice; * and Israel would · nót obéy me.

16. The haters of the [[Lord]] should have · béen found líars; * but their time should have endúr·ed for éver.
17. He should have fed them also with the fí·nest wheat-flóur; * and with honey out of the stony rock should I have · sátisfíed thee.

4. They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no · móre a péople, * and that the name of Israel may be no more · ín remémbrance.

42. And he brought forth his péo·ple with jóy, * and his chó·sen with gládness;

3. Blessed are they that ál·way keep júdgement, * – · and dö ríghteousness.
4. Remember me, O [[Lord]], according to the favour that thou bearest un·tó thy péople; * O visit me with · thý salvátion;

6. We have sinned · wíth our fáthers; * we have done amiss, · and dëalt wíckedly.
7. Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodness · ín remémbrance; * but were disobedient at the sea, even · át the Réd sea.
8. Nevertheless, he helped them · fór his Náme’s sake, * that he might make his · pówer tó be known.
9. He rebuked the Red sea also, and ít was · dried úp; * so he led them through the deep, as · thróugh a wílderness.
10. And he saved them from the ádver·saries’ hánd, * and delivered them from the hánd · of the énemy.
11. As for those that troubled them, the waters · óverwhélmed them; * there was not · óne of thém left.
12. Then belíeved · they his wórds, * and sang · práise untó him.
13. But within a while théy for·gat his wórks, * and would not a·bíde his cóunsel.
14. But lust came upon them · ín the wílderness, * and they tempted Gód · in the désert.
15. And he gáve them · their desíre, * and sent leanness withal · ínto théir soul.
16. They angered Moses álso · in the ténts, * and Aaron the · sáint of thé [[Lord]].
17. So the earth opened, and swállow·ed up Dáthan, * and covered the congregation · óf Abíram.
18. And the fire was kindled · ín their cómpany; * the flame burnt úp · the ungódly.
19. They made a · cálf in Hóreb, * and worshipped the · mólten ímage.

21. And they forgat · Gód their Sáviour, * who had done so great · thíngs in Égypt;
22. Wondrous wórks in the · land of Hám; * and fearful thíngs · by the Réd sea.
23. So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood befóre him · in the gáp, * to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he · shóuld destróy them.
24. Yea, they thought scórn of that · pleasant lánd, * and gave no credence · únto hís word;

26. Then lift he up his · hánd agáinst them, * to overthrow them · ín the wílderness;

28. They joined themselves unto · Báal-péor, * and ate the óf·ferings óf the dead.
29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their · ówn invéntions; * and the plague was · gréat amóng them.
30. Then stood up Phine·és and práyed; * and so · the plägue céased.
31. And that was counted unto · hím for ríghteousness, * among all posteri·tíes for évermore.
32. They angered him also at the wá·ters of strífe, * so that he punished Mó·ses for théir sakes;
33. Because they provó·ked his spírit, * so that he spake unadví·sedly wíth his lips.
34. Neither destroyed · théy the héathen, * as the · [[Lórd]] commánded them;
35. But were mingled a·móng the héathen, * and · léarned théir works.
36. Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned tó their · own decáy; * yea, they offered their sons and their daughters · únto dévils;
37. And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and · óf their dáughters, * whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was de·fíled wíth blood.
38. Thus were they stained wíth · their own wórks, * and went a whoring with their · ówn invéntions.
39. Therefore was the wrath of the [[Lord]] kindled a·gáinst his péople, * insomuch that he abhorred his · ówn inhéritance.
40. And he gave them over into the hánds · of the héathen; * and they that hated them · were lörds óver them.
41. Their ene·míes oppréssed them, * and had them · ín subjéction.
42. Many a time did · hé delíver them; * but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down · ín their wíckedness.

3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the éast and · from the wést; * from the · nórth and fróm the south.
4. They went astray in the wilderness óut · of the wáy, * and found no cí·ty to dwéll in;

6. So they cried unto the [[Lórd]] · in their tróuble, * and he delivered · thém from théir distress.
7. He led them forth bý · the right wáy, * that they might go to the · cíty whére they dwelt.
8. O that men would therefore praise the Lórd · for his góodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chíldren óf men!

15. O that men would therefore praise the [[Lórd]] · for his góodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chíldren óf men!
16. For he hath bróken the · gates of bráss, * and smitten the bars of í·ron in súnder.

18. Their soul abhorred all mán·ner of méat, * and they were even · hárd at déath’s door.

21. O that men would therefore praise the [[Lórd]] · for his góodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chíldren óf men!

30. Then are they glad, because théy · are at rést; * and so he bringeth them unto the haven · whére they wóuld be.
31. O that men would therefore praise the [[Lórd]] · for his góodness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth for the · chíldren óf men!

36. And there he sét·teth the húngry, * that they may build them a cí·ty to dwéll in;
37. That they may sow their lánd, · and plant víneyards, * to yield them · frúits of íncrease.
38. He blesseth them, so that they multi·plý excéedingly; * and suffereth not their · cáttle tó decrease.
39. And again, when they are mínished · and brought lów * through oppression, through any · plágue or tróuble;
