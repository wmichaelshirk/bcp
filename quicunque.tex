\subsubsection{Quicunque vult.}
\drop{Whosoever will be saved : before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholick Faith.}

2 Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled : without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

\drop{And the Catholick Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;}

4 Neither confounding the Persons : nor dividing the Substance.

5 For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son : and another of the Holy Ghost.

6 But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one : the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.

7 Such as the Father is, such is the Son : and such is the Holy Ghost.

8 The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate : and the Holy Ghost uncreate.

9 The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible : and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.

10 The Father eternal, the Son eternal : and the Holy Ghost eternal.

11 And yet they are not three eternals : but one eternal.

12 As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated : but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.

13 So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty : and the Holy Ghost Almighty.

14 And yet they are not three Almighties : but one Almighty.

15 So the Father is God, the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost is God.

16 And yet they are not three Gods : but one God.

17 So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord : and the Holy Ghost Lord.

18 And yet not three Lords : but one Lord.

19 For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be both God and Lord;

20 So are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion : to say, There be three Gods, or three Lords.

21 The Father is made of none : neither created, nor begotten.

22 The Son is of the Father alone : not made, nor created, but begotten.

23 The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son : neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

24 So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons : one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

25 And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other : none is greater, or less than another;

26 But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together : and co-equal.

27 So that in all things, as is aforesaid : the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.

28 He therefore that will be saved : must think thus of the Trinity.

\drop{Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation : that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.}

30 For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess : that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;

31 God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds : and Man of the substance of his Mother, born in the world;

32 Perfect God and perfect Man : of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.

33 Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead : and inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood;

34 Who, although he be God and Man : yet he is not two, but one Christ;

35 One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh : but by taking of the Manhood into God;

36 One altogether; not by confusion of Substance : but by unity of Person.

37 For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man : so God and Man is one Christ;

38 Who suffered for our salvation : descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead.

39 He ascended into heaven, he sitteth at the right hand of the Father, God Almighty : from whence he will come to judge the quick and the dead.

40 At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies : and shall give account for their own works.

41 And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting : and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.

\drop{This is the Catholick Faith : which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.}

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen.
